0,"'Altered' follows the capture of an extraterrestrial being by a group of men. We learn within the opening minutes that the creature is responsible for their abduction and torture - as well as the death of their friend - several years earlier.

The majority of the movie is contained within the residence of their reluctant friend Wyatt (played beautifully by Adam Kaufman who captures his character's grief and rage at the things done to him) where the group slowly begins to fall apart whilst the extraterrestrial begins to do everything it can to escape...

I hadn't heard of this film before I rented it and was pleasantly surprised to find that, even with a small budget, this was a tense (due to most events taking place in one location) and very well written little movie that kept my attention throughout. The creature effects especially were well done and managed to convey how dangerous and frightening the extraterrestrial was.

I'd recommend this to other horror fans as a shining example of how smaller budget horror movies can sometimes be far more effective than multimillion dollar blockbuster horrors dripping in overcooked CGI and underwritten characters!",8
1,"like sci-fi? like gore? if, like me the answer is yes then check this little gem out. its dog soldiers meets signs with a hint of the evil dead. Convincing performances from all the players and a well paced plot make altered a great film that just plane works. In recent years B movies have been plagued with bad CGI effects and I for one cant stand them. Altered on the other hand has Thomas Floutz, who was the special makeup effects artist on films like Underworld 1 and 2, X-men 3 and The Cave(and many more). So were talking top notch, old school special makeup effects, with only one or two really nice CGI shots where needed. It also has a great little appearance from James Gammon as the local sheriff. All in all its a cool movie thats nicely shot with solid performances, good direction, a well paced plot and lots of lovely gore, so if that sounds like your kinda flick then don't hesitate, rent it kick back and enjoy.",8
2,"Going into Altered I was aware of a couple things. One being that it's directed by the dude that directed Blair Witch Project. And two being that the story revolves around aliens. Another factor why I wanted to see this is because I'm pretty fascinated by all things unknown and especially anything related to extraterrestrial life. Well when this movie was brought to my attention I made a self-note and marked it on my to-see list. And I'm thankful that I did. Cause what followed was a pretty cool flick, with gore, and one badass little alien.

Altered is about a group of guys who are looking for a little bit of revenge. They're looking for vengeance because years before they were all abducted and tortured by some Evil Aliens (good movie). Anyways, they manage to capture one little alien who for some reason was lurking in the woods. There could be a reason behind this....but I'm a little forgetful, sorry. Well this little alien isn't just you're little E.T. look-alike, he's one tiny, ripped up, angry little sh!t with sharp-ass teeth. I'm still wondering if he is or isn't part of the Verdant's IFSP (Intergalactic Federation of Sovereign Planets) maybe as some suped-up, fighter alien. Most probably not though. Anyways, they get there hands on the little bugger and take him hostage. Obviously things go awry and what follows is a cool little horror movie filled with some nice make-up and gore...and one mean little s.o.b. The movie obviously isn't a flawless piece of work...the acting is average, the script is average and the decision making is questionable. But, these weren't any of the reasons I rented Altered. I rented it to see a alien flick with gore and violence and hopefully some tense moments and I got those. So if you're like me and you want to catch a neat horror flick with aliens and gore, check out Altered. A surprising 8 outta 10.",8
3,"Although it would be a stretch to call it original, Altered doesn't feel as derivative or as terribly schematic as so many similar features do. Bearing some occasional resemblance to Night of the Living Dead, with a touch of M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, and maybe a set up similar to John Carpenter's Vampires, director Edwardo Sanchez (who delivered the almost unforgettable Blair Witch Project) crafts a sufficiently effective creature feature, which may be silly, but doesn't feature a dull moment.

For seven years Cody, Duke, Otis and Wyatt have been hunting a mysterious race of Alien hominids which dwell in the shadows outside civilization. On the night that they capture a live one for the first time. They bring it home unconscious, but soon realize that they have made a big mistake. First of all, if they kill this creature, his buddies may declare war on humanity. If they don't kill it, the thing could escape and either brainwash or kill our heroes (the only ones who are even aware of the alien's existence)

Altered grabs your attention from scene one, and it maintains stability, but the climax isn't quite as solid as the rest of the film. The manner in which the last twenty minutes play out are the result of one coincidence or contrived moment following another. Of course it could have been worse. Sometimes these movie fall to pieces when trying to bring the stories to a conclusion. Some films don't even have a conclusion at all. (I won't give any names) I will say this for the climactic finale, The make-up job is sensation as we get to see the creature show us the full works, and the scene ends with a sensational wide shot of a spacecraft unlike anything I've seen since maybe Star Wars.

Altered concludes on a note which hints that there could be a sequel. One may doubt that something as small as this will see a follow-up movie, but lets not forget that even Uwe Boll's movies like Bloodrayne and Alone in the Dark (which most critics put on the worst films of the decade list) have somehow managed to get funding for even worse sequels. The point being, is that the idea of and Altered 2, doesn't sound so dumb, and considering that the film is surprisingly enjoyable, it might be interesting.",7
4,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!! I thought it started off very well. A novel idea, playing on the standards of both alien and revenge films. Kept me gripped for about 40 minutes... Then, well, I dunno. Seemed to lose a lot of the tension.

Also, during the film, much was made of the 'If we kill just one of them, they will kill all of us thing' the main chap said ""It wouldn't even be a war, they'd just annihilate us"" Right, fair enough. When, during the final part of the film, they (they aliens)attack the house, they do it by breaking the windows and doors with their hands. That'd be a pretty damn slow annihilation. One farmhouse at a time. And they seem to have they same resistance to nine-millimetre bullets as we do... Formidable foe? Or intergalactic, drunken teenagers? I've seen worse in pub car parks.

Still, it is was refreshing in it's novelty, and I can understand the defenders of this film.",6
5,"After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really an awful movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the acting is over the top en the story, oh boy, which story?

The story doesn't seem to go in a direction, first they capture the alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they capture it?). Then the girlfriend, who's acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she doesn't, then again, she does and then she doesn't. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race (and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces.

This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this movie.",1
6,"I watched it expecting it to be a cheap low budget movie. boy was I in for a surprise. Everything oozed class about this movie. From the camera angles, to the story.

Its basically a film where an alien is captured and than you have a dilemma from the group that capture the creature. and I wont go in to too much detail about the rest of the film. But it kept me glued to the end. There is enough suspense and a few genuine scary moments. The special effects were quite good too. This film has definitely got Cult Classic written all over it

A big thumbs up 9/10 for me .",9
7,"High-concept, with tight well-controlled shots, 'Altered' delivers tension from the get-go and consistently keeps the watcher intrigued, terrified, and on edge with a story that kept me enthralled first frame to last.

A frothy mix of gore, revenge, loyalty and more set in a dark (and fantastically lit) tone with a sci-fi overlay make this one of the best horror flicks I've seen all year.

Take the genius of 'Blair Witch Project', good story writing, limited camera angles, a hint of back story, excellent pacing and tension. Remove the bad camera work and sub-par lighting, add the details of good special effects and fantastic cinematography and you have an excellent second outing for director Eduardo Sanchez.

It's a never ending run of surprises and jump-out-of-your-seat reveals in the second half of this movie, with something to please every horror/gore fan. The payoffs are a welcome relief to the non-stop thrills this film offers, and it left me with a sense of a potential sequel. Great flick!",10
8,"After being ""taken"" by aliens 15 years ago, a group of good ol' boys decide to capture an alien themselves. Not really believing they will succeed, the guys actually do trap one and take it to a reclusive friend who seems to know an awful lot about the aliens. Made on a low budget, ""Altered"" does an admirable job sustaining tension, dropping just enough hints along the way to keep us engaged. Being that ""The Blair Witch Project"" wasn't really directed so much as improved, I had my doubts about Eduardo Sanchez's credentials, however, he displays a canny sense of the genre. Make-up and visual effects were superb belying the production's budget. Although the script was the weakest link in this alien stew, the film remains engrossing. Lead performance by Adam Kaufman is excellent. He carries the film well. Once again Eduardo Sanchez creeps us out by setting the film in the woods. This guy must really hate camping! A genuinely scary movie that won't disappoint its audience.",8
9,"(I suck at reviews but saw there were none for this yet so I figured I'd just let you all know this is definitely a must see for every sci-f1/horror fan out there.)

This movie sent shivers down my spine. It was a lot like the ones I got sitting in the theater watching Blair Witch for the first time. But this was somewhat different because it's a sci f1/horror/suspense movie, and one of the best I've seen. The alien in it literally scared the s**t out of me at times. I was always on the edge of my seat waiting for it to pop out of somewhere. Or for it's friends to come looking for it. The actors were all beyond good and helped big time in sucking you into the movie. The special effects and make up were that of a big Hollywood movie. The guy that decayed through out the movie was brilliant. The ending was equally as brilliant.",10
10,"Seven years after the incredible success of indie horror film The Blair Witch Project, director Eduardo Sánchez returns with this effective sci-fi chiller that proves that he still has the ability to creep out the audience.

In Altered, a group of men, who were abducted by aliens when they were young, face a night of terror after they manage to capture a nasty extra-terrestrial. Sánchez, once again working on a low budget, manages to create a truly scary film with some nifty effects to boot.

Using the trusty old 'man in a rubber suit' method, rather than dodgy CGI, Sanchez delivers a convincing and rather nasty little ET which is the stuff of nightmares; this is the kind of toothy critter that thinks nothing of disembowelling its victims and then playing a game of tug of war with their entrails!

With a lean running time of only 84 minutes, the film never has time to get boring. The cast give good performances, the direction is solid, the creature is creepy and a guy gets a flesh eating disease and disintegrates during the course of the film. What more could you ask for?",7
11,"Cody, Duke & Otis(Paul McCarthy-Boyington, Brad William Henke & Michael Williams)""capture"" an alien they supposedly injured to the home of Wyatt(Adam Kaufman). At first, we really don't know what's going on, but find as the characters converge that these young men were all victims of ""alien testing"" and Wyatt seems to be the token human who was able to outlast the experiments done to him. A dead friend's memory haunts the group as Cody was recently released from the pin for the wrongfully accused death of his brother Timmy. They take pride in capturing the alien, but have no idea that this was all a plan by the aliens to find the whereabouts of Wyatt for whom had been planted with a tracking device he had removed so that he could hide from them. So, the group will have to keep the alien silenced without killing it or risk the race of ET's exterminating the earth. Other problems that emerge..Wyatt's girlfriend, Foki(Misty Rosas)who wants to get away and call the police and a sheriff who answers the call of 911, Henderson(James Gammon). We learn that if an alien bites you, a type of flesh-eating disease takes hold of the body and that Wyatt seems to have an immunity to it.

One of the best ""aliens attack"" horror/sci-fi hybrids I've seen in ages. It's mostly confined to Wyatt's home as they fight to keep the alien trapped and quiet(it has it's own tracking device implanted for which Wyatt will remove). Cody is unhinged because of being blamed for his brother's murder and holds Wyatt specifically responsible. The film amazingly remains intense because of the alien threat and surprisingly the creature is quite well created by the filmmakers. And, even more stunning is how director Eduardo Sánchez(of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT fame)uses dialogue to suggest what happened to these guys instead of showing flashbacks..this saves a good amount of money, yet elaborates for us what these aliens did. The film has some gory make-up work as it pertains to the nasty flesh-eating disease that attacks one of the group who is bit by the captive alien.",7
12,"Me likes. Unpredictable and a taut thriller. Pace begins the second the movie starts and doesn't let the mood go. Very much like Night of the Living Dead, this is a LONG and suspenseful night that leaves you on the edge of your seat.

Plot line is also pretty original for an alien movie plot line. Don't think I've seen any with payback for an alien abduction. Even then, the plot took itself in new directions. Unpredictable.

OK, so I admit a bias, knowing the producing crew. Even if I didn't, this movie is still pretty darned good and worth a view. A direct to DVD gem that really should have made theatrical release.",9
13,"~Spoiler~

Altered is the sophomore effort from one-half of the Blair Witch team, Eduardo Sanchez. The film is about a group of men who were abducted by aliens when they were teenagers. Not all of them came back. And those who did came back altered. Now they spend a lot of time near the place they were taken, hoping to find either answers or revenge. They hit paydirt one night and capture an alien. Once they get the creature indoors, the movie takes off. It's a little hokey at times and some of the dialogue is horrid, but the cast makes it work. I was really surprised by the actors in this project. The only lead I had heard of before-hand was Michael C. Williams, also from The Blair Witch Project. But they are all quite good and help me stay with the movie when a Sci-fi Saturday cast would have ruined it. There's a fine line between cheesy and cool sometimes. I believe with a bigger budget the cheese could have been spread thinner. The alien could have used the Stan Winston touch if you get my drift. But I can't complain too much because it is a guy in a suit as opposed to CG silliness. After all the dough Blair Witch made, you'd think someone would give this guy a little bit more cash to play with. I really think with a bigger budget this could have been a hit.",
14,"I expected a lot more from this movie as it was billed as being directed by the man who directed Blair Witch Project (which I loved). However, this movie is a complete shambles.

The ""plot"" is an inane derivation of god knows how many other alien/abduction movies. The acting is without exception dire and seems to consist mostly of the actors screaming obscenities at each other. The special effects were poor. The plot holes were huge and seemingly endless. The aliens were about as scary as a bowl of ice cream.

All in all, a complete waste of time and DVD rental fee. Avoid like the plague.",1
15,"After seeing an advert for the film, it seemed quite interesting. The first Blair Witch film was OK, and the director could only get better with time right? Wrong...

The idea is good, a small group of guys taking revenge on an alien for what happened to them years before, and I'll admit, the first few scenes are great. Then it starts to go downhill, stereotypes become overdone and you can predict exactly how the character will react to the situation, it seems to have all been done before, only better and a little less obviously.

The punishment people take is plain retarded, leaves you thinking 'how the HELL is he supposed to be alive?'...think of 'Hollow Man' punishment but with a little more blood and gore.

I think if the characters were made a little less stereotypical and they seemed more human in terms of how much pain they can take, it would be a FAR better movie.

All in all, this could have been done far better with a more experienced director or possibly a better choice of actors, I'm all for seeing new blood on the screen, but not when it doesn't seem quite there yet.",3
16,"What Altered lacks in budget, it makes up for in atmosphere and tone. The story follows the lives of four men who were abducted by aliens as children. The fifth member of their group was killed during this event. Three of the men have spent the last 15 years of their lives trying to capture one of their captors. To their surprise, they manage to do so! However, capturing the alien is as far as their plans have ever gone. What to do with this being becomes the focus of the story, as well as revealing the back story of their past through heated dialogue. Their alien hostage proves to be far more dangerous and menacing than they ever expected. It seems that all horror films these days tend to inject ridiculous humor into their script. Altered stays on point, the serious tone remains throughout the entire film. This was a rare and welcome surprise. This film also manages to do something with its characters that I have rarely seen before. The characters that I really disliked in the first 20 minutes of the film I found myself having great sympathy for by the end. Such character development is very rare in low budget horror. The gore FX were excellent, and the makeup work was second to none. There's no doubt in my mind that this film will become an instant cult classic, if not already.",
17,"I'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez, who helmed the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I enjoyed.

But nope, unfortunately I felt that for the most parts, Altered is a waste of time, so I shall keep this review short. Premises are always promising, and Altered's no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so I shall not go into details, but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget.

What if you're given a chance for revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's a gleeful payback time, or so they thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it's low budgeted, there aren't many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. It's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.

What's good though is the makeup. Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I shan't mention, because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.

Watch this only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in town - Feast, this one is less fun, and takes itself too seriously. Bogged down by an uninspiring direction, you've been warned.",3
18,"It's a pity Eduardo Sanchez's jaw-droppingly terrible Altered has scenes which ruin its comedic momentum: character bonding sequences crammed in between an unintentional howler and the other. A pity, because any movie featuring a Mexican standoff with four men ready to jump on an alien who is holding the intestines of one of them, threatening to pull, had the potential to become garbage of the cult status variety.

A group of rednecks - the angry jerk (a Viggo Mortensen lookalike), the meek one (a Paul Giamatti lookalike) and the simple one (a generic big guy), all kidnapped by extraterrestrials fifteen years ago (don't expect a flashback, the ""show, don't tell"" mantra doesn't apply here), capture an alien and bring him to the country mansion of a former friend (a Colin Farrell lookalike), also abducted in the past, with revenge in mind. Still, the creature soon turns the table on them.

The script is a marvel of ineptitude: things happen randomly, with preposterous rules and plot holes (we are told the death of a single alien means war, but a whole platoon of them is wiped out and nothing happens). Suspension of disbelief is trampled under heavy boots: these morons know where UFOs land and, instead of telling NASA, the media or the Army, choose to face them alone. And they manage to capture one! Considering the average IQ they display, I had trouble believing they could successfully open a door.

The redeeming factor is the unintentional comedic streak running through the movie: apart for the already mentioned intestines standoff, we have a blue-green midget (looking like a smaller, meaner version of the Signs aliens) running with a sound of rushing footsteps, like Elmer Fudd chasing Bugs Bunny; a protagonist who hides in his basement a nuke powerful enough to reduce his surroundings like Tunguska; a grasshopper-like spaceship jumping from Earth to Moon.

It works as a spoof, better than most intentional horror parodies.

19,"I'm 47 years old and I've spent as much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi films. Be they silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them that I can't find something to like about. That said, I'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all. This is a case of effects over story. Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film. Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn't even have good acting, only good effects. So unless you can only about the gore, pass this one up.",1
20,"First question: Why aliens who have the technology to travel in spaceships would walk naked and without guns or protection in a dangerous forest, specially after they had killed and abducted people in that area? Well, after that, you can imagine what comes along in this ridiculous movie. (sorry for the English mistakes, I'm from Brazil). I think maybe the screenplay was written to show a kind of animal or monster and along the production they decided to change to an alien, and they forgot to solve a lot of problems in the story. Only that could explain the huge amount of problems and holes in this horrible movie. Well, to match this stupid screenplay, there is yet terrible acting, a bad direction of photography and a amateur directing. After all the problems, at the end, nothing in explained about the aliens who walk naked and with no guns or protection in the forest. If we go to other specific problems, I could write hundreds of pages. One example: besides walking naked and with no protection, the aliens have mental power over the humans and great technology to travel in the space, what only could be possible after a great evolution, but they still have nippers and teeth of savage animals and act like those (and they don't use clothes or space suits). Completely incoherent. It isn't sci-fi, it is only a cheap and bad horror and gore movie using wrongly the concept.",1
21,"I'm gonna give this a five. But only because I felt they had the right idea. It seemed like the filmmakers really wanted to do something new with the who Alien abduction angle, but it did feel a lot like retread waters. The obvious comparison to Dreamcatcher can be made...but this flick takes that in a different direction, it just falls flat.

I was very surprised by some of the actors, though. Mike Williams is the only actor I recognized (him being in Blair Witch), but the other 4 actors in the flick were pretty good. They did their best with what they had I guess.

Another thing this movie had going for it, I think, is that it had some really good creature effects for a movie that obviously didn't have a huge budget. And the gore is pretty decent as well. It's a shame the story couldn't keep up with the FX though.

I look forward to Eduardo Sanchez's future work, just to see where else he'll go from here.",5
22,"This weekend just passed I watched ""28 Weeks Later"" which was very good. After that I watched this film.

I have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no plot. The alien creature was unreal. And the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight. And to make it worse the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film.

Forget about this movie; rather go and watch 28 Weeks Later.

Cheers, Mesake C.",1
23,"The scared rednecks Duke (Brad William Henke), Otis (Mike C. Williams) and Cody (Paul McCarthy-Boyington) hunt and capture a dangerous creature in the Nixon Farm and drive to the isolated house of their friend Wyatt (Adam Kaufman) to ask what to do with it. They recall that fifteen years ago the quartet plus Cody's brother Timmy had been kidnapped in the Nixon Farm and submitted to experiments by aliens and Timmy did not survive. Nobody in town believed in their words and Cody was accused of killing his brother. However Wyatt advises them to not kill the alien since he could be tracked by his breed and they would jeopardize the human race. But the powerful extraterrestrial being controls the mind of Wyatt's girlfriend Hope (Catherine Mangan) and brings horror and death along the gruesome night.

""Altered"" has a confused and boring beginning since neither the situation nor the characters are well developed by the screenplay. Further, the stupid trio of characters that open the film is non- charismatic. However, after 30 or 40 minutes running time, there is an explanation and the viewer finds that ""Altered"" is an original sci-fi story with touches of horror and the plot finally becomes interesting. In the end, this is the typical low-budget movie that uses few locations and special effects that works. Based on my experience, I suggest the viewer to give a chance to this film and he or she may like it. My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): ""Aterrorizados"" (""Terrified"")",6
24,"Once again this film maker makes democracy work. He did it with Blair Witch which I did not like and he did it here again with Altered. Completely different but equally creative. But in Blair Witch you never get layed. Here you get up close and personal. This film has guts. It is one of the very few mixtures of Horror and Science Fiction that you love. Best of all this is old school. No computer dimensional cross dressing. This is straight up monster. My only complaint they don't give you many perks. No extras but two boring deleted scenes. But you know what it fits this is lean, nasty and mean and good. This very little I like, this is surely one.",9
25,"A movie with potential, and promise, but somehow fails to meet the ends. You could sum up the movie, by saying it performed best, with the quality it was given. In personal bias, I'll state the movie itself could expand, further with the ideas it had. Giving it, an average rating. Everything centered around that statistic, average acting, plot, but the concept of the enemy was what was interesting.

The holes in the plot are minor, but they still should have had depth. How did this happen? What about this? It didn't give a deep intrigue towards this, but gave the amount necessary to at least grasp it, albeit somewhat.

These are all personal thoughts, but i enjoyed the movie. A settling horror flick, around your friends, or alone, but not worth more than maybe 10 bucks.",5
26,"This is a pretty trippy film, though I mean that in the most non-hippie way possible. It drops you in the middle of confusion and trusts you to be smart enough to figure it out yourself. By the time you do, you'll probably notice some flaws. But until then, Altered will take you on a fairly gripping ride.

Since figuring out what's going on is one of the appeals of this movie, let me try and describe it to you in a way that reveals as little as possible. 15 years ago, something terrible happened to 5 rednecks. There was Wyatt (Adam Kaufman), the best of the group; brothers Cody (Paul McCarthy-Boyington) and Timmy; high school football star Duke (Brad William Henke); and tag along Otis (Mike C. Williams). What happened to them killed Timmy and left the rest of them outcasts. But last night, after years of trying, Duke, Cody and Timmy have finally gotten the chance for some revenge. They don't know what to do with that chance, so they seek out Wyatt. He's been living for years as a paranoid shut-in out in the woods with his new girlfriend Hope (Catherine Mangan), unable to get past what happened 15 years ago. So, his three old friends come to Wyatt. On a table in his garage, they chain down a green beast with teeth and claws and eyes that can control a human brain. Then they ask Wyatt, ""What do we do now?"" What Wyatt tells them is hard to accept. What actually happens is something they won't all live through.

Altered is a crazy-cool idea for a movie and these filmmakers pull it off relatively well. I'll get to a few trifling criticisms, but I first want to state that this film not only keeps you guessing, it gets you interested enough to care. The actors make you believe these are ordinary people who've been bent out of shape by an extraordinary event. The direction is direct and lets a complicated tale unfold without any bells or whistles. The intensity is ratcheted up bit by bit until you're ready for something remarkable.

Unfortunately, nothing really remarkable occurs. The ending isn't bad by any means, but it is much less smart and much more formulaic that the rest of the film. After a heck of an effective build-up, the payoff in Altered isn't really anything to get too excited about. It's also true that these characters aren't nearly as good as the situation they're put in. They don't have a lot of depth and these filmmakers don't seem to know how to balance the story between them.

Given the stinking, pus-drenched detritus that makes up much of the sci-fi/horror genre, the weaknesses of Altered are quite minor. Grading on that curve, this movie is probably an A-, something a sci-fi/horror fan should really see. On a more objective scale, it's somewhere between a B- and a C+, something that might not blow you away but you won't regret watching it.",6
27,"ALTERED is directed by one of the directors of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Straight off the top - I HATE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. I don't care about the fan-boys who think it's scary/creepy, etc...I found it nauseating due to the shaky camera-work and dull to the point of narcoleptic. ALTERED is from one of the directors of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which is why I wasn't in a rush to pick this one up. At the recommendation of a few people I trust, I decided to give it a shot. I have to say, that although I didn't find it the film to be as ""BRILLIANT"", ""EXCELLENT"", or ""FANTASTIC"" as other reviewers - it's an entertaining piece of sci-fi/horror that while flawed, has an interesting premise and is worth checking out.

A trio of hicks who had been abducted by aliens years earlier are bent on revenge. Going back to the abduction-point repeatedly, they finally accomplish their goal, and abduct an alien of their own. They take the creature back to their pal's house (who was also an abductee) to either find out some answers, or mete out a bit of backwoods justice. Thing is, the alien is a wily little creature that isn't easily defeated...

Even though I hated the director's previous film, I have to say that when I heard about the premise of ALTERED, I was intrigued. Luckily for me, the film works on most levels - but I can't say it's anything truly ""great"" either.

The good points: again, the concept is pretty original. The FX work is pretty damn good for a relatively low-budget film, and I like that there is very little CGI in the film, instead opting for the alien to be a (pretty well-made) costume. There are a few decent gore scenes that are notable, especially the guy that starts deteriorating after being bitten by the alien.

As for low-points: the redneck characters seemed a bit cliché and simple. I personally would have found it more interesting had the abductees been more intelligent individuals. I was also hoping that we'd get to see more revenge on behalf of the humans, instead it turned into more of a typical ""us-against-it"" film as the alien quickly escapes the abductees grasp.

A decent and entertaining film that I personally thought didn't make the most of it's concept. Worth checking out, but I can't say that ALTERED is anything truly ground-breaking either...7/10",7
28,"I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments. ""Unique"", ""intelligent"", ""A future cult classic"" and so on... you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort.

Because alas, Altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. The silliness is not funny. The horror and gore is not scary. And whatever ""thinking"" aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.

OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor acting. It's not a stretch to say most B-movies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs actually do better.

It's really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences.

If there is a major flaw in Altered, it's the main set. A major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but Sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. But no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.

There's nothing salvageable here. Die hard fans of ""Blair Witch"" are better off following Daniel Myrick. Although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).",2
29,"My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us Blair Witch Project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage. The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot, such as there was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them. Mother F seems to be the ""writer's"" favorite because it is used constantly. It must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call. Thank God I rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward. Don't waste your time or money with this.",2
30,"Director Eduardo Sanchez, well known for The Blair Witch Project, directs this film made directly for the DVD merchandise, which talks about a group of men that share one same event in their life: they have been abducted by an Alien species that captured them while they were on a hunt, and killed one of the group. While they had the chance to prove they were abducted, one of them, Wyatt, disproved everything and the story sinked in oblivion. Many years later, three of them succeed in capturing one of those vicious creatures. Because of this, they get themselves chased by the rest of the Aliens - and are forced to seek for help. They go to Wyatt himself, who, after his close encounters, has bought a house, customizing it with measures for eventual attacks. And there it begins. The Alien, chained, is brought inside and thus abducted, in a way. The bad news is that this Monster has psychic abilities (It can control the mind of a person after a long eye-to-eye glance) and its bite causes progressing necrosis, and as even worse news, it freed itself from the chains and caused a blackout. The film from this point progresses with a growing tension, a bit ruined by the obvious gore (always present in straight-to-DVD Horror flicks), really forced in some cases, like when Otis is gutted and the Alien tends the intestines across the room, trying to put an organic tracking device, or the progressing decomposing flesh of Cody. The characters are decently built mainly through dialogue referring to past events (which most of the film's plot is built around), the pacing is good and the creature effects are excellent despite the low budget. The Alien has an interesting design and indeed contributes to the overall tense and creepy tone of the film. Recommended for those who are experienced with Monster Movies.",8
31,"I really enjoyed this little flick. I believe the creative team had some difficulties getting the movie out in the public, but I'm glad they overcame the hurdle. There is a nice new spin on the story of 'alien abductees', where the humans are taking revenge on the aliens. A couple of things where you are left in the dark - story wise, but you can overlook that, and, I believe, get a nice kick out of it. SPOILER: One Thought though... what are the odds that the house dosn't just collapse on top of Wyatt's little 'escape capsule' when he blows everything up, in the end, and is being left inside there, with no way out?!",7
32,"To be short, a nice idea but it didn't work out right. It fails everywhere to keep the movie going, things said about the past the ""friends"" had makes you think like ""wait a sec. this is lame"". The movies gives no explanation about it's story, and it looks likes all the money was spent on special effects and then there was none left for good actors or a nice plot and story.

And man does that alien looks stupid, more like a sarcastic Roswell parody than e mean alien thing.

(and yes i know i may have used incorrect English, but then again it's not my first language but i think you get the idea)",1
33,"Too bad that I could not give zero star, the system simply wouldn't allow. I knew nothing prior to watch this flick. The 5.8 stars seemed to be promising. I couldn't have been disappointed more. This is trash from the very beginning to the ridiculous ending. In fact at the final cut scene we were laughing hysterically asking each other if that LAME ending was really meant to be serious or what. I'd like to write a few words about the plot and direction if it were any. Sadly, there was none. Nada. The acting was low. Really. The characters had no dimension, they always made the most illogical moves in every possible situation. A complete waste of time. Stay away from this one.",1
34,"Apparently, various crew members have posted comments and reviews on IMDb...that, ONLY, would explain the glowing responses to this really bad hunk-a-junk flick. Horrible acting...terrible script...it's all here.

""Blair Witch"" was indeed a one-hit wonder.

This film cribs every scene; there isn't an original idea to be had in the 80 minutes of running time.

It's nice to see ""Blair""'s Michael Williams back in action, however.

Not sure why IMDb lists the budget as $8 million - it's obviously incorrect.

Skip this one - watch ""Blair"" again.

UPDATE: One of the producers contacted me directly, to berate me for this review. That's kinda sad.",
35,"hi this is my first comment on IMDb , I'm huge fan of Si-fic & horror movie i love movies that include aliens or abduction but this movie let me down it had decent special effects & had new idea but the acting and the movie story is below the average there is no character building you have no emotional towards them the tense and the thriller is not there at all just a few scenes and thats it ...

maybe I'm old for this or I'm not ... but i think this movie is uncompleted or rushed to be put on the screen

too bad whats the use of all the effects if you don't know how to use it to your benefit.. i don't know whats had gone wrong with this movie but its nearly boring and not that exciting at all so i give it half stars just for the good effects and the idea behind the movie and thanks for reading....",5
36,"I have read the posts on this site before viewing the film, so i kind of had an idea of what was expected.

But all I can say is !WOW! Great film

From begins to end, The concept of actually capturing one and that if they kill it it might be the end of the human race. I liked Wyat's analogy of ""Do you know what happens when an animal kills a human?"" awesome.

Want to see the DVD for special features.

Do you think there might be a sequel? There are some good grounds for one.",9
37,"This movie started off with a great idea - a group of people hunt and kidnap an alien and then have to figure out among themselves where to go from there.

There was a lot of promise in that premise, but unfortunately it disappears somewhere along the way. From a potentially smart, sci-fi horror movie, it became a generic monster movie at some point. The most scary part of it all were the continuity errors, which stack up substantially by the end of the movie. Some of the actors perform admirable, but it's not enough to save this crash and burn of a movie. The characters are stereotypical and boring.

I've seen amazing horror movies made with a fraction of the budget of this movie (Yellow Brick Road and Dead End come to mind), and I'm guessing most of that money went towards the CG effect and alien costumes. Both of which were awful.

Only watch it if you are really,really bored and have already seen ALL other films in existence.",2
38,"Some rednecks who were the victims of alien abduction in the past decide to turn the tables on the malevolent ETs. They catch one of the reptillian critters, ferry him to their warehouse hide-out, tie him to a table and get busy...

This is how its done. A tightly written script. The perfect combination of prosthetics and CGI (just a touch) for the creature effects. A wildly tension-fraught premise. Unknown actors giving serious, committed performances.

Altered is one of the best indie flicks I've seen in a long time. Along with the recent ""Splinter"" and ""Alien Raiders"" this is a refreshingly well-done thriller. Eduardo Sanchez shows a very sure hand behind the camera.",9
39,"It was interesting to watch, kind off get's you after the first half....... the movie it's really that full of action, but it has it's moments the fight with the alien it very wheel made, and also there is some good special effects.The sheriff it's kind o stupid, dies rather stupid. i was disappointed in the end...when the massacre didn't came...disappointed like in ""what if we would've kicked there asses?""..... the alien it's quite ugly and not very friendly :)...the end it's made really good, the entire movie doesen't puts you in that direction of the final. it's a good movie to watch...didn't waste time with it. Enjoy!",7
40,"I cannot believe the positive reviews for this dreadful movie.

I had read the reviews and they encouraged me to watch this absolute load of trash.

I enjoy sci- fi because it's the unknown we are dealing with, but this movie was simply garbage from start to finish, and the alien I could have built myself in a garden shed, it was laughable.

This sci fi horror was basically a non starter for me, and the guy who had his insides pulled out by this alien, surely should have been dead, and not alive screaming his head off.

Okay we all have different tastes in films, but I cannot understand anybody thinking this film was brilliant, which one of the reviews stated.",1
41,"Altered is a sci-fi revenge film done by the same team that made The Blair Witch Project. Like Blair Witch this film is not for everyone. Some will like the film while others will hate the film. I am one of those people who liked this film for the most part. The movie has a very depressing atmosphere, but I think it fit the story. I liked most of the characters and felt their plight, though there are two that I did not care for. The effects I think are very well done for the low budget that this had.

Fifteen years ago a group of men were abducted by aliens and altered. One of them died from the alterations. Now the aliens are back again and these men are out for revenge. The film starts out with them capturing an alien and bringing it back to the lead guy named Wyatt. They cannot kill it because more come then. The alien escapes and it is then a fight to stay alive.

Like the Blair Witch Project, this film gets a lot of hate. Many people do not even know about this film. I think this film is pretty decent though nothing great. I like most of the characters and definitely had sympathy for them. Even if you do not like the characters in the movie you can at least sympathize with them. Even the characters I did not like I felt sympathy for. I especially like the main character, Wyatt, because he is the most calm and collected in such a dire situation and is a good leader. I also like the characters Duke and Otis. They were also level-headed most of the time and can also be funny. I also liked the sheriff character that appeared near the middle of the film. He was not there long, but was in the film long enough for me to like him.

I did not like the girlfriend of Wyatt. In the beginning I thought she was really annoying. I get what she is going through, but I still thought she was annoying at first. She gets better by the end but I still do not really care for her character. I do not like the character Cody either. Again I sympathize for what he is going through. His brother was killed by the aliens, he was imprisoned for a long time before the start of the film, and by the end of the film he dies in a horrific way. However, I still found him to be an annoying prick throughout the first half of the movie and he did a lot of stupid things. The other at least could still be level headed during the situation.

I thought the effects for this film were great. The budget for this film was only eight million, but they used it effectively. There is no CGI. The effects are all practical. The alien looks great. It looks kind of like the alien from Signs but even better looking. Also in the film there is a character that is bitten by the alien and his body gradually deteriorates throughout the movie. When you see him with his body deteriorated and fragile, it looks great. That effect looked amazing.

Another issue I have is the ending. It seemed a little out-of-place when compared with the rest of the film. It is kind of left up in the air, but I felt that the film ended too happily, but maybe that is just me. I am not usually a fan of downer endings, but the tone of this film makes a happy ending seem out-of-place.

Overall, Altered is a fun alien film, horror film, and action film. It has decent characters (for the most part), great effects, and some good action in parts. If you are a fan of any of those genres of films then check this out. It is not a masterpiece but it is not supposed to be.",7
42,"Decided to go through my Netflix streaming last night & watch a film. Of course, I went right to the horror section. There sat ""Altered,"" a film I thought about watching several times in the past, but passed it up for something else. Well, all I got to say is, I waited way to long to see this film!

""Altered"" is a mean, lean, sci-fi/horror machine! There is no fat to be found here! Five friends get abducted by aliens 15 years before. One of them dies. One of them lives & hides. Three of them go out in the wilds of Florida to hunt down one of the aliens for fifteen years, & are finally successful. What transpires afterwards is a taunt horror thriller that delivers in spades! The acting is top notch, though I have to admit, the first twenty minutes I thought this was going to be a dumb redneck film? I'm sure glad I continued watching, because there is definite method to their madness, as the script reveals real people, not just another hillbilly stereotype exploitation film!

After succeeding in capturing an alien, the three friends start to realize exactly how foolish they've been, that is, all except for one, whose brother was killed by the aliens. He was blamed for his brother's death, even by his own father, & put in prison. His performance may be the finest of all the fine performances here, as he spews hatred for the alien, wanting it to feel all the excruciating pain he went through. A portrait of pure unadulterated revenge, where nothing or no one is going to stand in his way of satisfying it. Also of note is a girlfriend, who gets caught up in this & takes matters in her own hands, literally. A strong female protagonist performance, a rare thing in low budget sci-fi/horror films. All this makes for a very good character study of a group of friends splintered emotionally, & how their forced to deal with the tragedy of the past, & impending the doom of the future.

""Altered"" is no big budget film, but the special effects are fine & the aliens look good. I've seen better make up in higher budget films, but still, the aliens were malevolently convincing.

If you want a white knuckled sci-fi/horror thriller, ""Altered"" is as better than most films of its ilk in the last ten years. A superior effort, especially when you consider it was released straight to DVD!",8
43,"A group of pals catch an alien, they tie it down to a bed in the garage, it looks at one of the fella's girl, she goes a bit nuts, they tie her up, the sherriff comes and he gets killed, the alien bites a guy so he starts turning alien, the other two get ate by the alien, then the guy realises he can stare at the alien and kill it, but then the aliens pals come, the guya nd his chick lock themselves in a bunker and blos up the space ship and the aliens, end.

the acting was worse than school kids in a nativity play, the special effects were that of drunks on halloween trying to prank their spouses, there was no storyline or plot whatsoever, please do not waste your time with this utter garbage. its basically gremlins, but one gremlin. pah!",1
44,"7.2/10 As a huge fan of alien films, I've seen many lists and articles including this as a very underrated gory alien offering on a small budget. The director Eduardo Sánchez, who has definitive experience in crafting simplistically effective creepy films on tight funds clearly shows that talent here once again in even better fashion than Blair Witch Project. The overall story takes some time at first to develop within the group of 4 friends and their ""guest"". As pieces start falling together and developing it gets damn right insane and visceral and the tension gets extreme. I thought the action packed finale was spectacularly executed and satisfying and made up very well for the duller first half. The practical creature effects on the alien are top notch and very impressive for the production budget, as well as the brutally disgusting gore effects which do not let up for the entirety. The dialogue was absolutely ridiculous at times especially with the Cody character but it gave the film a certain personality and comedic aspect at times. The setting was a bit too limited as it was essentially shot in a couple rooms of a house but that's to be expected on a lower budget. The scenes where they were out in the forest at night were very ominous and I think they could've expanded the overall setting by utilizing that environment more. Overall this was a surprising alien film that shows you can do a lot with a little with the right people on board. I also recommend Sánchez's Bigfoot film ""Exists"" for a similarly solid story on a humble budget.",7
45,"I like Eduardo Sanchez, the director of 'Blaire Witch' and 'Lovely Molly'. Sure, 'Exists' wasn't too good, but of the four movies I've seen of his, 3 were really great.

'Altered' is a sci-fi/thriller/horror hybrid. In a nutshell, it's a movie about a few hillbillies who capture an alien in the woods years after having been abducted and experimented upon by the same extraterrestrial menaces. They bring the captured yet alive E.T back to one of there friends house, where horror and havoc ensue. I'm not going to go too much into what happens from there as that would be giving away the movie, but the plot is simple enough to be interesting without getting convoluted.

The first thing I liked about this movie is that it clearly had a pretty limited budget. IMO, that worked out in Sanchez's favor, for instead of gratuitous use of CGI for effects, we get good old fashioned puppets, costumes and great make-up. It looks like a really good horror movie from the late 80's/early 90's which was a golden age in terms of special effects for the horror and sic-fi genre IMO.

Most of the film takes place in one of two rooms, which creates a sense of claustrophobia and tension. Ridiculous as the premise may sound, it is not a light-hearted or campy movie. There is a constant sense of dread and fear, and the actors do there job without too much backstory to lend towards this effect. I also must commend the make up artist and costume designer. The Alien looks great, probably the best portrayal of an E.T since H.R Giegers' Alien design. The gore is noteworthy as well if you're into that kind of thing. When one of the red-necks becomes infected, it truly is pretty sickening .

Unlike a lot of his other films ('Blaire Witch', 'Exists' and 'Lovely Molly') there is no 'found- footage' angle or use in 'Altered', which is a nice change of pace. I've said it before, so excuse me for being redundant, but while I don't mind the 'found-footage' technique when it's applied in a way that makes sense, it's nice to see a talented director like Sanchez step out of what I imagine might be his comfort zone and achieve with some grace, a traditional movie in terms of cinematography (it looks great btw).

Fans of Sci-FI and Horror will both like this movie. It's kind of sad to think that this one's probably been overlooked, and truth be told, had I not known who directed it, I would never have rented a movie with a cover which screams 'B-MOVIE'!.

My only complaint is that I wish it was a bit longer, but really, everything was quite satisfactory. A nice change of pace for the director of 'Blaire Witch'.",7
46,"Just a slice of pure sci-fi fun. Enjoyed the actor playing the part of Wyatt. He was also enjoyable to watch in TAKEN. Always appreciate live action movies as the CGI has been far over done. The characters interact well and their development isn't over hindered by a straight forward plot. The guys play well off of each others giving a real feel of friendship, although strained during this incident. The female character, Hope comes across as truly upset and angry at the invasion of her home. An invasion by both Wyatt's friends and the ALIEN The scenes are well plotted and work well in terms of continuity. The alien creature is sufficiently nasty ad as fun to watch as the creature in ALIEN. I own the DVD and watch it frequently.",8
47,"Altered is a horror film by director Eduardo Sanchez (known for Blair Witch Project). Often, straight to DVD ""creature features"" such as this could turn out terrible, with awful special effects, abysmal acting, and a horrible script. Luckily, that is not the case with Altered. The entire film has a tense and unsettling tone that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The practical effects were great,and some of the graphic/gore scenes were extremely disturbing. The acting was very good and dialogue between the characters felt natural and realistic, not forced and expositional. The story relies heavily on events that happened before the film and were never shown, however it does a good job of slowly revealing things at a natural pace and not spoon- feeding the audience information to drive the plot forward. My biggest flaw with the movie is the fact that there are some annoying horror cliché moments, the most prominent example being the scene when the power went out for NO reason other than to make the scene more intense. There were also a few predictable moments. There were times where I was thinking ""Now this is going to happen"" and it did. But to be fair, there were plenty of unexpected moments as well, so that sort of makes up for it. Overall, Altered is a very tense, well-paced, and well-made horror movie that is definitely worth watching.",8
48,"I have seen this once before, years ago, I really enjoyed on my first watch but on my second watch I felt a bit different.

I didn't enjoyed as much as my last watch but this time I bloody LOVED IT!

I loved the effects in this movie, they were outstanding, I really enjoyed the story was nice and dark and there were some rally good tense scenes in this movie, that never falls flat.

I liked how Alien looked looked and really enjoyed some of Gore effect in this movie.

I wasn't big fan of last scene of movie, it didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.

The acting was decent from cast but some poor acting in a few scenes.

Great movie! 8 out of 10",8
49,"In Altered, the director puts the ""alien abduction"" scenario on it's head. We've all seen movies and TV shows about alien abductions. They're a genre into themselves. But what happens when the abductees decide to kidnap an alien themselves? This is the question the director attempts to answer in a movie which can be taken as serious or comedic. Years ago, four friends were kidnapped in the wilds of Florida by aliens from outer space. They were eventually released, but only after the invaders had ""done things"" to them. Now they are grown men and the laughing stock of their small town. Nobody believed them at the time, nobody does now. Finally, tired of the ridicule, three of the four head out to a remote farm where the aliens have established a hidden compound. They manage to capture one of the aliens and haul it back. Their prey secured in a van, they take it to the last member of the four, Wyatt, who lives on an isolated compound. Wyatt is horrified; he's got a girlfriend living with him and still has vivid memories of what the creatures did to him. He's also in a psychic link with the aliens and knows they will be furious at having one of their number captured. All hell breaks loose when the captured alien breaks free in the compound. And, worse, a whole ground force of aliens are on their way to rescue their fallen comrade.

The plot is tight. The film opens with the capture of the alien, then speeds to Wyatt's compound, where most of the action takes place. The actors who play the trio responsible for snaring the beast all do a top- notch collective performance as a bunch of confused and scared rednecks. The actor playing Wyatt has just enough fear and bravery to make him a great horror movie hero.

Plus points to the team who did the effect work on the alien costumes; it was done without CGI. More plus points to the people who did the stunt work.

I recommend giving this film a chance. You might be able to find a cheap used DVD.

50,"Well first off I want to say that this is one hell of a horror movie. A good one that is. Suspenseful to the very end without a dull moment in between.

The main characters in this film were basically a bunch of dumbass rednecks who couldn't have been the real heroes in this movie. Mainly because they were all too stupid and pathetic. They were all portrayed in a stereotypical way as one would come to expect when one thinks of rednecks in general.

I was cheering instead for the alien creature that was decimating them off one by one. I hated most of that group. Especially that one named Cody who ended up in the bathtub rotting and dying away slowly and miserably. I would have gladly fed him to the alien monster myself. Shooting him to end his misery for me would have been out of the question. I would rather have seen him die slowly and miserably. And gloating over it too. He was worthy only of one's contempt.",7
51,"WOW I just finished watching this movie.I was so surprised to like it after watching Blair Witch Project Years ago.From the beginning to the end is like riding a roller coaster.The Acting is really good and the Dialogue is Great.I hadn't even heard anything about this movie until I got it in my DVD store rental selections this week.It is really Graphic and Grotesque and not for the week stomach.If you are a Zombie movie fan then you will love it.Its like nothing else you have ever seen.I don't Usually comment on these sites about most movies, but I feel I had to on this one,so others might try it out.Like I said if you like Zombie Move Gore then this ones for you.Its Got a lot of Dialogue Like the HBO series Deadwood,so if dirty language doesn't offend you then you will be pleased.Best Horror Sci-Fi Alien Story I have seen since Taken, Even has one of the Actors From Taken go figure.",10
52,"Eduardo Sanchez has been biding his time since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but he's back now with ALTERED and it was worth the wait! It's a fascinating, scary and tense take on the ""Evil Aliens"" sub-genre that also includes XTRO, DREAMCATCHER, SIGNS and, well, EVIL ALIENS *g*. But unlike the latter film, ALTERED is no comedy. Four backwoods buddies were abducted by aliens. 15 year before, and are still traumatized. Cut to the present day, and they manage to catch one of their tormentors, and extract some payback. Only this alien has a pathogen-delivering bite, loooong claws and Psi-Powers, and doesn't take kindly to having the tables turned on it...

I've loved Adam Kaufman (Wyatt) ever since he played Jack's boyfriend Ethan on DAWSON'S CREEK and Parker on BUFFY, and this film is a real tour de force for him- he's great. It was also nice to see Mike Williams has escaped from the clutches of Elly Kedward at least long enough to deliver a sympathetic turn as Otis! The special effects in the film are also excellent- there's a scene involving a flesh-devouring virus that includes the most hideous and realistic depiction of contagion I've ever seen, and a tug of war with a loop of intestine that starts out blackly funny, but ends up being very touching when the character, devastated by the extent of the wound, repeatedly cries out for his mother.

Keep watching the Skies!",10
53,"If Seinfeld is the show about nothing, Altered is the movie about nothing. These four friends were abducted by aliens fifteen years earlier, so these geniuses decide to get revenge by kidnapping one of the aliens. They accomplish their goal, but once they do, they don't know what to do with it and lock it in the garage. After that it becomes a slasher film where nothing significant really happens. Honestly, they kidnapped this thing and then don't know what to do with it, so then what's the point? To make things worse, we never see the abduction or find out what exactly happened to them up there. It's just an extremely dark and confusing hunting scene, which believe it or not features a harpoon, and then there is nothing else. As for the acting it is just as inconsistent as the story! One minute their going crazy, trying to kill each other and the next they're crying about old times, it's ridiculous! James Gammon is the only name in this thing, playing the sheriff in one of his last roles. The guys are so intimidated by the sheriff and when we finally see him, we find out he's this little eighty year old guy, are you kidding me? This movie is a complete disaster and an utter waste of time. Being that it's from the writer/director of The Blair Witch Project, I was expecting something as groundbreaking as that was, unfortunately, Altered isn't it and there is a good reason why you've probably never heard of it.",3
54,"Really, one of the untalented hacks responsible for ""The Blair Witch Project"" also directed this flick? I did not see that coming! Okay I realize that ""BWP"" is a type of love-it-or-hate-it horror movie, and I shouldn't obtrude my negative views upon other people before they watch it themselves, but I sincerely hated that hyper-annoying and wannabe original movie with a passion and I damn all existing copies to hell. ""Altered"" is mediocre at best, but definitely a vast improvement over ""BWP"", if only because it doesn't have that aura of pretension and pseudo-inventiveness over it. ""Altered"" is at least straightforward and  even more importantly  director Eduardo Sanchez actually has a story to tell this time! The surprises just keep on coming because the basic plot synopsis is also very good. It's your average tale of alien invaders, abduction and psychical experiments (though no anal probes as far as I know), only  in reverse this time. The dodgy-filmed opening sequences  that brought back painful memories about the aforementioned ""Blair witch""  show three men chasing some sort of shape through the woods and into an ambush. They then nervously drive up to the house of a fourth buddy where they expose their catch of the day. These childhood friends caught themselves a real extraterrestrial visitor and we're also gradually informed about the motivations for their obsessive hunt. The script neatly unfolds bit by bit, as painful verbal flashbacks reveal that they were captured by this exact breed of aliens and a fifth friend  one of the boy's brother  didn't survive the close encounter. They waited years to extract their blood vengeance, but all sort of complications arise. ""Altered"" benefices from a solid concept, tense atmosphere and a handful of extremely masterful sequences, but still some fundamental things are missing in order to label it a true success. The film lacks involvement and you absolutely feel no connection with the characters. The main guy Wyatt supposedly represents the most reasonable and identifiable character of the bunch, but he actually is the least likable and, personally, I felt more sympathy for the crazed and out-of-control redneck Cody. Also, there are too many implausible gimmicks that exclusively serve to easily fill up the possible plot holes and shortcomings in the script, like the odd alien tracking devices, and several of the sub plots are never competently explained, like Wyatt's abilities to resist the aliens' experiments. Some good gore and make-up effects keep the quality level above average throughout the whole playtime (one of guys gradually goes through several states of decaying, another one literally has his intestines pulled out), but it's not good enough to become a future genre classic.",5
55,"I'd not seen this film before or even heard about It despite It being six-years-old at the time of writing, but I'm really glad that I've finally got to see It. Fifteen years before the time In which the film Is set,a group of 4 young men were - as Is gradually revealed to us as the movie progresses - abducted by a large group of humanoid aliens who are living on Earth and subjected to various experiments. One of the young men,Timmy,died and two were released,the last one,Wyatt,being selected for further 'treatment' and kept a little longer. Most of the Movie takes place In Wyatts' home but from the opening scene right through to the very end the action Is almost constant with no chance of becoming bored. The Aliens look excellent with some superb make-up and the special effects are top-notch. When one of the guys Is bitten and develops a disease, the scenes of him gradually festering and rotting away look totally convincing. Add to this a good storyline with some excellent acting, particularly from the four main characters (although there are only 6 characters plus the aliens In the whole movie)and what you have Is one of the best Movies of It's genre as I've ever seen. Excellent.",10
56,"I was pleasantly surprised with Altered, and I really enjoyed it. The storyline is rather different than your run-of-the-mill alien abduction themes. However, it definitely pays homage to some classics.

Warning: intense language. Although, I don't mind some obscenities and vulgarities in movies when warranted, there were times that I thought the characters forced them gratuitously.

There is no nudity in this film (well, except for the alien!), nor is there sexual content.

I was also unimpressed with the woman's character. I think she added little to the plot. The actress portraying her was sub-par.

Spoilers!!!!!!!

The plot: some years ago, seven youths were abducted by aliens for experimentation. Present day, has some of them turning the tables on the aliens ,when they kidnap an alien scout. The alien escapes and havoc ensues.

Though a new take on this genre, I couldn't help but see similarities between this film and Predator - the illusive nature of the alien, the cat and mouse chase in the woods ,the design of the creature; Signs - the creature in the protagonist's home; Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the X-Files - alien spaceship shining lights into windows and freaky cacophony.

End spoilers!!!!!!

Overall, I recommend this film. If you can tolerate some cliché characters and dialogue , hover to your favorite store and abduct Altered.",7
57,"I got my head summary from another blokes comment but it hits the spot.

In this film, it is the humans who abduct an alien. 3 guys, and later on a fourth, get an alien from the forest. During the movie U realize they were ones abducted by aliens themselves and this is payback time.

How monsters with such claws are able to build a rocket is a mystery to me and there are some strange things about the story. It is a thriller, but also a horror. It just can't choose, and does not quite get the genres work together all to well. But it is exciting. The aliens don't go slash people. It just four men against one mean alien. It is just exciting to find out what is going on. Later on in the movie there is some gore (what's with the intestines flying around?).

The actors are pretty good, the story has enough tension, but is also kind of strange to give it a real good score. so 7 out of 10 because of the actors and originality.",7
58,"I thought this was a very suspenseful movie. A bit gory in parts, but way better than I expected. The progression of the movie involves three men chasing and catching a creature, and it becomes apparent that there is a history between the men and the creature. They involve a fourth man, who has also been involved with the creature. From there on, as the past comes out, everyone is in danger, and it is sometimes not clear who has trapped who. Some may not like the ending, as not all possible questions are answered, but I enjoyed it.

I was apprehensive about this movie, since the director also did Blair Witch Project, which I did not enjoy. Maybe too much hype at the time, but that is another story. But this movie is not done in that style. It is a straight suspense, horror movie. I liked the way the story of the men's past came out throughout the movie. I am a bit surprised this movie has not been viewed more widely, but maybe with time.",7
59,"In fact... the alien in 'Altered' doesn't so much want to borrow a landline to call his mates, as batter you to death with the mouthpiece and then eat your remains while you're still warm. In short, this film contains the most angry extraterrestrial since that invisible one in the jungle that gave Arnie and his mates such a hard time.

We treated to the tale of a handful of your stereotypical 'rednecks' from the 'deep south' of America – you know the types – the ones who we always laugh at when they go on the Jerry Springer show and claim to have been abducted by aliens and had a dodgy encounter with an anal probe. Anyway, these are our heroes, only they really did come into contact with beings from another world (and they probably wished that it was only anal probing that was on the menu!). In short, they drew the short end of the straw during first contact and now they're out for revenge. And, by way of an amazing coincidence, several years later they go on a hunt to their local woods and only go and capture an alien alive. Then they take him back to one of their houses and decide what to do to him.

But – guess what – the slimy, green man with big teeth only goes and gets loose. All hell follows.

'Altered' is hardly a classic film that will stand the tests of time for its acting, plot, originality, or generally any other praise-worthy point. But it isn't half good fun.

Growing up with the exploits of Scully and Mulder during the nineties, I have fond memories for alien abduction stories. Whether they're real or not, they make a good yarn. And this one is no different. It's totally UNoriginal, but none the worse for it. It's basically a slasher film, but, instead of not knowing who the insane killer is stalking our heroes, we know from the start – the alien. It's just a question of killing the slippery little thing (and obviously staying clear of his razor-sharp teeth and claws).

It's actually quite fun to root for the rednecks. I seem to have lost count of the amount of times they've been portrayed as the baddies. Now we get to see them hold their own against a hideous alien with more teeth than all of them put together. There's no real outstanding performances, although I had a strange liking for the big, dumb 'Duke.' The alien himself is seen in all its glory and is basically a man in a rubber suit, but he does his job. In fact, some of the special effects (or should I say 'gore?') are pretty impressive. So, if you like your slasher films with a healthy dose of sci-fi in there you could do worse that watching this little gem of a B-movie.

Plus, special mention to the 'rope-pull intestine' scene – still makes me squeamish and I've seen this film a few times now.",8
60,"I was really surprised with what I got from Altered. Its a movie i've heard nothing about, so i wasn't expecting much, but what i got was a very thrilling, entertaining and suspenseful film that deserves more recognition than it gets.

This movie creates something that is difficult to do. Build a dreaded atmosphere and icy cold psychology! I thought the idea behind the story was creative, while not trying to do too much with it. Its simple to follow and the characters contribute to some hidden depth.

If you want a film that will give you more than just blood and guts, then Altered is one worth checking out!",7
61,"Altered is a great horror/sci-fi film with a straight story, good ambiance and proves that you don't need a $100 mil budget to create suspense. Also a really underrated one in my opinion.

The film starts with a bunch of rednecks that hope to trap an alien (to extract revenge), since back when they were kids they were abducted. They have been trying to trap one of them nasty things for years and this actually became an activity to drink outdoors. None of them actually believe that they would catch an alien or even know what to do with it if they ever catch one. That is, until one night...they actually manage to trap one.

It is really a great decision that the director took not to use CGI to portray the alien. Instead we have a man in rubber suit and a bit of good ol' animatronics (that's where most of the budget went methinks :) ). Some might find the alien ridiculous but I for one found it quite menacing. The film also have great make up effects like the sickly body of Cody— which was f*cking great.

The film is not only about the alien and the ambiance of course. Each of the bunch actually has a character and depicted quite well throughout the running time of the film. You actually care about these guys. Some you might dislike but some you might like. Also the sheriff is a great little addition but Wyatt's girlfriend would be my only complaint as her character has no depth whatsoever other than being a screaming running bitch. Gore is not used gratuitously and it looks also great. The director really made good use of the cabin combining with great outdoor forest shots to create an eerie atmosphere.

Verdict: if you are a fan of sci-fi/horror definitely go see this. Don't get put off by its IMDb rating.",
62,"That was going to be the original title to this film.

Ans they were gonna make it a comedy! That would have been interesting to see but I'm glad they just kept it the way they did it.

They was some decent acting and scares around.

Adam Kaufman as our hero ""Wyatt"" did an OK job.

His 3 partners-in-crime, big Brad William Henke as ""Duke"", Michael C. Williams as ""Otis""(from Blair Witch) and Paul McCarthy-Boyington as ""Cody"". Did OK also as some ""good-ole hick-boys"" alien hunters.

Out of those three, Paul McCarthy-Boyington as 'Cody', stood out for me. His portrayal of Cody, reminded me so much of David Patrick Kelly. The same compact, feisty and slightly crazed-look. His Cody was like a grenade with the pin pulled.

It was a very nice surprise to see the late great character actor, James Gammon as ""Sheriff Henderson"" in one of his last film roles before he passed away.

Ala in all, not a great film but not a bad one either. Check it out!",
63,"My cable providing is showing this movie for free. I know why. It is an also ran movie. Typical B movie fare that in the 70s I would have watched on a double bill with a good movie. If you gave the late great Don Dohler 8 million dollars this is what he would have come up with. Classy in a bad way.

4 friends went out on a party night and to party was to get high. They loaded up on beer and cocaine and they started their fights with a roar. They could not have known that tonight was going to be the beginning of their longest tour. That is a song of the revolution by night by Blue Oyster Cult. The guys meet an alien 15 before, then they kidnap one 15 years later. They decide to take revenge and bust a cap up the alien's botty but it does the dirty on them again. It really is such a naughty alien. For me they should have given it a severe Ccastigation and then let it go back to being Prime Minister of the UK.

It has to be said it is better than the blair witch project. The creature effects are okay but the movie really shines when see the mutations.",6
64,"Did not know that it was from the director of Blair Witch. Because of the director you might think this is going to be a low budget film shot in a mokumentary style with a shaky camera, but no this is a B-movie horror flick that seemed comedic, in other words campy, but it stays in the grey area of campy and serious with lots of gore but interesting story line. The story seems loosely based off of the Fire in the Sky story. It goes into more detail about the same kind of story. But that film was a drama with sci-fi sprinkled on it, so these two films won't even seem related, but if you are into UFO stuff this is all familiar territory. My main disappointment was with the alien, I didn't mind the rubber suit, it was just that I wish they had shown the typical grey alien that somehow gets morphed/adjusted for the earth forest. Kind of like how our military fatigues change for different types of terrain. Because it wasn't explained in the film, I figured that the reason why the aliens were experimenting on people and wanted Wyatt back was for warfare reasons. I imagine to the aliens we are like bacteria. They could probably easily send a biological/chemical weapon that would wipe out 99% of the population, but just like anti bacterial soap, sometimes, the bacteria can come back stronger. So I assume the aliens wanted to see how much humans can adapt and evolve, and Wyatt had been one of their best specimens that went really far. I'm obviously reading way too far into it, but it made me say to myself this makes sense and accept what was going on in the film. I'm not a gore fan and this film has plenty of it, but the fact that it made me think this much, tells me it had potential and the story was interesting. Expect a B horror film with an interesting plot, the budget however didn't seem that low actually.",5
65,"I wrote a massive review for this but the computer screwed it up, so let me just say this.

Every review here is a lie, this movie is mind bendingly bad.

The actors suck, the plot is hard to follow, there is no connection with characters, the special effects are fairly bad in some areas (alien) and the movie isn't scary at all. All this mixed with a bunch of illogical scenes that will leave you scratching your head make this the worst horror ever..

DO not see this just because this guy made the blair witch project, this is real bad compared to that.",3
66,"This had to be the most stupid and boring movie that I ever saw in my life. Some other reviewers felt the movie would have been better if it had a bigger budget. No, it would not. If anything they should have started with a coherent script.

Basically, these guys catch an alien and take it to a friend's house who was abducted the longest. OK, so let's start with the Alien. When you finally see it, it looks like a cheap Halloween mask (blatantly plastic and phony looking). That being said, I guess special effects aren't their thing.

When they bring the alien to this guy's house he has an arsenal of weapons ready to kill any alien that returns to claim him. However, he keeps warning his buddies not to kill the alien that they captured because it would mean the other aliens would wipe out the human race. Really? If this alien was so easy to capture, and if it was so easy to kill in the end, then I seriously doubt that this species has the ability to wipe out humanity. Later, his girl friend keeps trying to leave, but when she finally gets to go she says ""I'm not leaving you."" What? She's been trying to leave all night and now she's in love again and not leaving her man when he tells her to go?

Later the alien has escapes and holds one of his friends hostage by pulling out the guy's lower intestines and grasping them as if to rip them totally out of the guys body. When the friends are at a standoff with the alien (the alien holding the intestines as if to pull them totally out of cut them in half and the guys with guns fixed on the alien) the friends decide it would be better to wrestle the alien while it's holding their friend's intestines rather than just putting a cap in it's head before it can pull the intestines. I'm not kidding, you can't make this stuff up people.

In the end, the friend who keeps saying not to kill the alien returns with a shotgun in his hands. Why? If killing the alien is the end of humanity, then why a shotgun? BTW, how does being abducted as a child give him this great knowledge of knowing that killing this alien would be the end of humanity?

Let's get back to the girlfriend. At the end she walks in like a bad-ass and kills the alien by putting a cap in its head. Then, later, she's frozen by fear. Then later she's a bad ass again. This goes on through the entire movie folks. After they kill the alien a whole bunch of other aliens come to exact their revenge. The house is surrounded by aliens breaking their way in. So the guy takes the girlfriend under the house where he has a bunker with a detonator to blow up the house should aliens invade it. Now he blows up the house, killing I don't know how many aliens. Keep in mind that this is the guy that kept telling his friends not to kill the first alien and watch the alien kill his friends one-by-one because killing the alien would have resulted in the end of humanity.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that they keep saying not to look in to the aliens eyes or it will take you over, which it did when the girlfriend looked in to it's eyes. However, later in the movie one of the friends is torturing the alien and looking directly in to it's eyes with no problem. This goes back and forth throughout the movie. First the alien has the power to hypnotize, then it doesn't.

At the conclusion, they guy kills all these aliens and guess what? No invasion, no mass extinction. Instead, he and the girlfriend ride off into the sunset.

That's the movie - judge for yourselves people.",1
67,"Eduardo Sánchez was one of the people that went off into the woods and shot some footage of people running around shouting in 1999. This footage was later released as 'the blair witch project', a supposed film which will forever be remembered as both the worst film ever made and one of the biggest rip-offs of all time. In a way you have to hand it to Sánchez and co, they made a lot of money for doing practically nothing, but on the other hand - I'm sure I'm not the only one who wasn't expecting anything all cinematically from anyone who helped in bringing the worst film ever made to our screens. You can imagine my surprise, then, when I tentatively decided to watch Sánchez's ""Altered"" and found it to be halfway decent movie! Obviously the only way was up, but it's still a pretty big surprise. The plot focuses on a group of men who, while out hunting one day, got abducted by aliens. Not happy to just take this on the chin, the men go back to the place where they were abducted sometime later to abduct one of the aliens, for revenge purposes...

The plot springs from an interesting idea. Usually its aliens abducting people, so to make a film that does things the opposite way is an interesting concept. The film is short, running at around eighty minutes, and that's not surprising really considering that interesting concept does get stretched out over the running time. One of the biggest things I hated about blair witch project was the fact that absolutely nothing happens in it; that is not the case here however! It seems Sánchez was keen to dismiss what happened with blair witch as he doesn't hold back with the gore and showing the alien in this film. The alien itself does look more than a little bit silly, but it's good that we get to see it so I can't complain too much. There are some nice gore scenes too - one in which someone has his intestines ripped out being the best of them. The acting isn't great...actually it's pretty crap, but that's not too important considering that I didn't go into this film expecting great performances. Overall, this is not brilliant - but it's pretty decent stuff and I can recommend it.",6
68,"Another DVD-watch from 2007 and a damn good surprise this one was! When you give it no further thought, it seems almost unimaginable that this film was made by the director who previously did ""The Blair Witch Project""... I enjoyed ""Altered"" about 10 times more than his first film. Tight, tense and gripping thrill-ride about alien abduction told ""Night Of The Living Dead""-style (as in: most of it takes place on one location, being an isolated farmhouse). But don't worry, ""Altered"" has enough twists & turns up its sleeve. Decent effects and quite some gross looking special make-up too. I place this one on the same pedestal as more recent horror outings like, let's say, ""The Descent"" and ""Feast"". Though all three are pretty different movies in their own right, if you like one of them, you'll probably like the other two also.",9
69,"I stumbled across this one while browsing the instant view movies on Netflix. I had never heard of it and expected the worst: my girlfriend and I expected to see a movie we could laugh at and rip apart. What we got was a rather terrifying and fun Lovecraftian-esquire ride and once the credits rolled we were very, very pleased with what we saw.

The effects were good, even the ""guy in the rubber suit"" looked cool. The gore was great looking but not overdone (thus making it all the more alarming when i was on screen). The way people rotted from the infection was particularly cool! One thing that annoys me, even as a New Yorker, is when movies make hillbillies *too* hickish to the point of parody. It takes a lot away from movies that are supposed to be serious. These guys were believable, especially as the movie wore on. For some reason, the beginning of the movie was the weakest in this regard, i.e. the hunt. But once the movie kicks in things get good.

As far as acting goes I thought everyone did a great job. The weakest was the sheriff but he's only on screen for a brief few moments. The core actors and actress did a good job and I was impressed with how realistic their reactions to many scenes were.

The plot is summarized on this site, so why waste time doing so here. But I will note this: the fact that they can't actually kill the alien without risking the annihilation of the human race makes it particularly horrifying when this thing is hunting them and vice-versa. No matter what this thing is doing to them they-can't-kill-it! It adds a nice dimension to the movie that I haven't seen in an alien movie before.

In closing, I greatly enjoyed Altered as did my girlfriend, and since seeing it we've spent a lot of conversation time talking about it. The movie had a Lovecraft vibe going on, and with both of us being HUGE Lovecraft fans we can't recommend this movie enough. Is it A-List Hollywood? No... thank god! For the record my mind is blown by the negative reviews. It's almost like they didn't watch the movie or something...",9
70,"This is a combo of a lot of different alien flicks and shows. Mostly though I was reminded of Fire in the Sky & Invaders From Mars. Altered doesn't really stray too far off the beaten path in terms of setting and scenario but it does or should get credit for having an all unknown cast playing rednecks against the typical Larry the Cable Guy/Ernest stero-type. Altered begins at the last half of a group of friends story who were abducted by and experiminted on by aliens. We find out their back story little by little and very little and never through visual flashbacks but instead through the actors own retelling. This is a hell of feat that should be complimented and praised because the entire weight of this movie rest on their shoulders. What also aided my enjoyment was the brisk pacing even though a good portion of Altered is drama and humor and some horror. Thing is there is enough horror here but not a lot when it happens its stunning and unflinching and very very brutal. I had no idea or opinion of this movie going into it because there really is nothing said about it anywhere. I love horror films and this year more than any in a long time there have been a a lot of releases from Grade A to Z and they've mostly sucked.I know its all subjective but that is my opinion. My favorite horror films of 2006 are Roost,HellBent,Feast,Chainsaw The Beginning,The Descent & Silent Hill and now Altered. Most of the above never saw the light of day the rest tanked so I either like garbage or im onto something. Don't know.Don't care. Altered is a damn good movie one that I will recommend and re watch for years to come. To all those other reviewers here who said Eduardo Sanchez will do amazing things one day I couldn't disagree more. He already is.",8
71,"I really wasn't expecting anything from this movie going in. Nobody had reviewed it, and there was no hype, unlike the director's previous Blair Witch. Honestly it looked to me like a film the studio was embarrassed by, and therefore dropped straight to DVD. Speaking of the DVD, which has no extras', it's obvious the suits' had no idea the genre gem they had in there hands'. Altered did everything right, it was suspenseful, well acted, and featured some slick makeup effects. I really felt for each of the friends, and rooted for them to come out of it in one piece. Why this didn't get a theatrical release I do not know, but it definitely wasn't originally intended to go straight to DVD, as the production values are top notch. I read that this film was originally suppose to be an over the top dark comedy, but despite some funny dialog here and there, this was quite dark and serious. Characters' suffer greatly, and it got much nastier then I anticipated. My only complaint is the film doesn't directly answer every question, and ends on a sequel note, that we will probably never see. It doesn't totally leave you up in the air, but certain questions about one characters' abilities, and the reason behind there abduction, are never answered. This film doesn't portray the aliens', as misunderstood, and peaceful, as so many recent movies have, but as mean, vicious creatures, who have no problem killing and torturing, to get what they want. Props to the cast and crew, Altered is an excellent revenge story, and top notch in every way.",10
72,"The scenario of this movie was superb. A House in the middle of the woods with an alien tied up, 3 redneck friends, a strong headed woman, an alcoholic cop, and 1 normal dude. There is a lot more to it than that, but thats the basic premise. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, rent something else! For being a b-film they did an incredible job. The Cinematography was great creating a creepy atmosphere. They made full use of surround sound. I don't know why more films try to take more advantage of the surround sound. The dialog was great. There wasn't too much action or dialog, it was a good blend! It made me jump and cringe which is also rare, especially for me! There was only a few bad things to mention. I had higher expectations of what the alien would look like. It was nice that they didn't try to save it for the very end which seems to be far too common in sci-fi movies. It almost reminded me of the old school Creature from the Black Lagoon.

In all reality I give this movie 8.5, but since I can't rate it as that I gave it benefit of the doubt with a 9.",9
73,"ALTERED is a nasty little Sci-Fi/Horror gem that packs on the suspense and dread. There's something here for everyone: Gore hounds will be pleased, people looking for scares will be pleased, those watching only to see the aliens will be pleased. Everyone wins! Unless you're not into Horror flicks. In that case, go watch You, Me, and Dupree.

Some rednecks who were abducted by sadistic and savage aliens manage to capture one of the monsters that tortured them and killed their friend years ago. Of course, it gets loose and it's buddies come looking for it. I know it doesn't sound very good, but believe me when I say that ALTERED is one creepy movie. Let's not forget how well developed some of the characters are. For once, the cast isn't made up of pretty twenty-somethings with no emotion or backstory! Now about the aliens. These things are nasty little buggers. When they bite you, they infect you with a flesh-eating sickness. They have mind-control powers. They have a tendency to dismember victims. They also are able to survive being shot, harpooned, and bludgeoned several times. That last part was one of the film's few flaws: Again, the monster appears to be using some sort of invincibility cheat.

Overall, ALTERED is a well-made, freaky, creature feature that you should check-out ASAP, if you're into monster movies.",8
74,"Eduardo Sanchez's new film is everything it looks to be. That's kind of a problem. You get the setting, the creature and the action that you expect, but little else. The movie moves along with some solid entertainment, but there is no sense of originality and spirit that you can hold onto. Mr. Sanchez claims that ""Altered"" is a film he has wanted to make since high school. Why can't the audience grasp the magic and wonder that made this story so appealing to him through all these years?

Sanchez is one of two directors who banded together on the luckiest student film of all time, ""The Blair Witch Project."" ""Blair Witch"" was a movie that got by on its so-real-it's-scary thrills, despite technically home-made production values. ""Altered"" is a movie where the opposite must be achieved; fantastical, cinematic scares must be created through impressive production values. Good influences are drawn upon to reach such a goal, with some scenes that whiz by on doses of Speilbergian suspense and Raimi-like atmosphere. Sanchez himself is a competent director, but doesn't prove to be a strong enough force with ""Altered."" This is the kind of marketable, cheaply enjoyable movie you'd expect to see on a late night stretch of Sci-Fi channel, when it should be a sound directorial piece for fans of the science fiction and horror genre.

As I said earlier, ""Altered"" is certainly well-done. Great things are done with lighting, cinematography, production design, sound design and special effects. The creature is detailed and scary and a lot of fun scenes are done with it. The opening is absolutely terrific, with an attack of creative sound design and a sequence which plunges you right into the story with no questions asked. I liked how an elaborate back story on extraterrestrial life is pushed aside, as to prevent any distractions. The movie is about five or so people in a small house combating the complications of a kidnapped alien life. Action and suspense are on the top of the priority list, and the point is understood as is the audience. If only more films were this straightforward!

The problem with ""Altered"" is that it doesn't push quite far enough. It is perfectly comfortable being a mediocre, marketable sci-fi picture to turn heads on the New Release rack. ""Altered""'s comfort with itself is a good thing, because the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and it delivers the goods with no distractions. It is a bad thing too, because when the fun is all over, there is little to remember or hold onto. Eduardo Sanchez may be perfectly fine making slick movies with good distribution deals. Who wouldn't? However, film fans and sci-fi/horror buffs surely should expect more from him.",
75,"Here it is again! A story that could have developed into something interesting...maybe. But, this production was brought down by the acting of the main characters, or rather the lack of acting! The worst was the female lead. The best acting was on the part of the dead guys! The aliens were, well, aliens. We don't know how real aliens act, anyway, so any alien performance must be tolerable. I've always thought that a good dose of Tub & Tile cleaner was a great way to protect myself from alien attack. Keep that little trick in your anti-alien kit. I think Universal could have put to better use the $8 million spent on this. They could have added another ride in the amusement park!",2
76,"I like it as far it had some good action moments that put me at the edge of my bed. Enjoyed the gore and some of the ponds in the movie. I'll recommend watching this movie on a nice Sunday evening..... just because its a chill Horror movie.

I wish they would add more to the movie, meaning more information on what happen in the movie, because it didn't kind of start story off into a chase which was pretty interesting. This by far is a good alien movie to watch because its like the humans are now fighting back, but like in a cool hill billy way. For a movie made in like the mid 2000's passes for today film.",7
77,"I bought this movie from a garage sale, only because of the cover. It seems like a cheap flick and so it is. But the suspense all through the time was way better than most of disappointing blockbusters. In my point of view a good thriller is the one which makes you want it to end as soon as possible. This is all about it. I just wanted it to end like now :)The characters were realistic. Just needed some more info of what happened earlier. The guts out guy was some thrilling moment about how an alien would treat a weak earthling. Even though the fx was not sufficient most of the fans of the genre would like this gem. Perhaps producers planned a second movie of what happens to Wyatt next. And then again, perhaps the critics did not make it well to happen.",8
78,"The movie has a promising premise. rednecks got abducted by little aliens on steroids, probed, and god knows what else. The rednecks then decide to go abduct one of them. now thats bad-ass. from there, things get kind of grey. its almost as if the script was written by someone who was bi-polar. Like every creature of the unknown, they come with rules and stipulations. while the rules are spottily explained throughout the movie, they are contradicted, broken, and in the end, just seems like an excuse to have a movie, rather than it being ended in the first few minutes. IF YOU Haven't SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, BY NO MEANS READ THE REST OF THIS. when a writer and director go over a script and plot, at some point, someone has to realize that people will critique it, and by god, maybe it should make sense. these are my main problems with the plot.

1)if you had spent 7 (?) years trying to capture an alien, would you not have figured out what the hell to do with it by then? 2)The girlfriend is just a huge question mark. ""i hate you, i don't, im leaving, but back, i want to go live with my mother, i never want to see you again, ill never leave you"" 3)if you had a very dangerous being captive, would you not secure the damn thing in every possible way? duct tape? these things have solved intergalactic travel. 4)why does everyone manage to let their attention wander from this thing at some point? especially after the 2nd or 3rd time it escaped. 5)the ""sheriff"" shot through a door. on the otherside of which, people were screaming and obviously fighting for their lives. to make a point? 6)the ending, while achieving maximum bad-ass effect, contradicted the whole movie. although the revamped ""flaming bag of poo on the doorstep"" gag in the end was pretty priceless, and actually connected with something said earlier in the film. it may have been the only time that occurred in the movie.

6/10 if only because with the budget, and the intestine tug of war, it was entertaining.",6
79,"Well I have not reviewed a horror film in a while. So I randomly decided to pick out a horror film. And I guess I got this film.

Firstly I was actually surprised by this little film. I was not expecting such a film from such a minuscule budget. This film is very , very, gory . Definitely not for the faint hearted. Tons of f-words and swearing. Perfect for a horror film.

The film is about a group of friends who were apparently abducted by aliens 15 years ago. In which one of their friends died. Now three of the four friends were able to abduct one of the aliens. And they brought it to the fourth friends house, in which his girlfriend is living there also. Now the Aliens are coming back for them and in which the friends cannot trust each other they must figure out a way to survive the night.

So the plot may not have been the best or original , but it manages to work well and plus all the actors were very believable to boot. The story may have been a mixed bag, you know with the ""friendships being tested"" and "" girl caught in the middle"" routines but they are surprisingly well done. The director definitely knows what he wants . The camera work manages to make the surroundings look cold and scary. The cinematography also plays a part in this film , making most sets look dark and pitch black. Although I do have one problem with the film and that is the CGI . Maybe it's just me but I really feel that the CGI was just not believable. It almost made me want to laugh during the serious bits of the movie.

But other than that the movie is definitely a good rental on a Saturday night. Good to watch with friends if they want to get the crap scared out of them.",7
80,"It's been a long time since a movie scared me, and this one succeeded at that straight from the beginning. I like it when movies do that. I really appreciate how the story leaves you guessing and wondering what is going on most of the time, you find yourself questioning what happened before with whom and why, and you don't get all the answers, which to me is a good thing. Makes one remember a movie. Even though it's a sci-fi story, and it has some funny details, for the dirt you get to see it holds a lot of facts often thought of as true, keeps you grounded in reality just enough to scare the living daylights out of you.

There wasn't one moment where I thought the budget must have been small, which probably is a huge compliment for the FX/make-up people involved. The casting and acting were superb. Good thing the screenplay ads just enough criticism to their characters to make you buy them as believable. Very well written dialog. Highly recommended for an interesting thrill.

*mild spoiler coming up*

I thought everything about the setting came across as stunningly honest, except for Wyatt's bunker-door. Should really have been thick concrete to survive a blast like that. But that's nit-picking.",7
81,"I started watching this movie because I saw a lot of positive reviews...now I wonder about the sanity of those people...

This is THE FIRST review I ever wrote for IMDb, and this movie made me do it! At first, for a few minutes at least, it seems promising. Then it starts sliding a slope and it keeps accelerating. The acting is bad, but even worse are the characters' lines. It's as if they were retarded. A four year old would make decisions that make more sense. And the whole story, if you can call that mess a story, makes no sense at all.

Then comes the production which is very cheap, but that really isn't the problem - I've seen movies with lower budgets that were great. This one had a really great potential atmosphere-wise. We've seen it all - an isolated house, a bunch of people barricading in because of the possible attack by unknown evil forces (here: alien), with a somewhat unique twist - they have one captured... it could have been at least an average flick, but - trust me - it's utter crap! They say smart people learn from other people's mistakes, and stupid ones learn from their own mistakes so I'm not sure if you'll want to hear the advice of a sucker but I did step in a load of poo here, so don't say I didn't warn you! 2/10",2
82,"Four men are determined to get revenge on the vicious alien life form that held them all hostage and killed their friend. However, the quartet all find themselves in considerable jeopardy after their plan doesn't work out the way that they expected it to. Director Eduardo Sanchez, working from a tight and gripping script by Jamie Nash, relates the involving story at a snappy pace, ably crafts a tense and spooky atmosphere, maintains a dark, grim, and serious tone throughout, builds plenty of nerve-rattling suspense, and delivers a handy helping of shockingly gross'n'gruesome gore (one guy gets a hideous flesh-eating infection after he's bitten by the alien). Moreover, the evil extraterrestrial is convincingly brought to terrifying life by a guy in a funky rubber suit and proves to be a truly formidable piece of nasty work. The excellent acting by the capable no-name cast keeps the movie humming: Adam Kaufman as the troubled Wyatt, Catherine Mangan as Wyatt's feisty girlfriend Hope, Brad William Henke as the sensible Duke, Michael C. Williams as bumbling wimp Otis, and Paul McCarthy-Boyington as the reckless and belligerent Codi. Veteran character actor James Gammon likewise registers well as the crusty Sheriff Henderson. The loyalty displayed amongst the main characters gives this picture additional touching depth and resonance. The succinct 88 minute running time ensures that this film never becomes tedious or overstays its welcome. Steve Yedlin's sharp cinematography makes stunningly effective use of shadowy lighting. The shuddery score by Tony Cora and Exiquio Talavera does the skin-crawling trick. A worthy shocker.",8
83,"Loved this movie. Imagine a group of hillbillies living through an alien abduction and finally getting the chance to get THEIR turn. When it first starts, it looks like it has the potential to be a cheese-fest, but as it turns out the acting is very well done. The actors play their individual characters almost to perfection. They are what they are: Small town country boys trying to redeem themselves, but unsure of how to finish what they started.

I have no real criticism of this film because it accomplished exactly what it intended. It was very, very fun to watch, although it wasn't scary from the audience's point of view, but the actors showed fear in a way that was true to their respective characters. The casting was just about perfect. Each character behaved exactly as you would expect them to.

I was surprised at the quality of the creature effects and the effectiveness of the makeup artists. A couple things, namely intestines, weren't so impressive, but everything else was well done, especially when one of the characters develops an infection caused by an alien bite. I can't say enough about how well done the effects were.

It's really the same kind of movie as Tremors as it doesn't want any emotional investment from the viewers. It just wants to entertain. Eduardo Sánchez outdid himself with this one!",9
84,"I'm not sure why I never heard of ""Altered"" and I'm not sure why it wasn't released for vast distribution. This is a strong horror with a bit of mystery and delivers in fast-paced, often gruesome action.

Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, one of the writer's behind ""The Blair Witch Project"", brings us a killer, in-your-face action horror that doesn't let up. In fact, when the movie begins, we truly feel like we've been dropped right in the middle of it and have to hold on for one wild ride.

The only problem with this movie is what happens to many a horror - it gets too dark. I mean lighting-wise of course, making it difficult to see some of what's happening. Other than one other sound effects glitch, the movie is fast, ruthless and unforgiving.

Definitely check this one out for yourself. Hopefully, you'll be just as surprised.",8
85,"There is so very little horror out there that is even acceptable, but this one is definitely above average. I watch these movies for the adrenaline rush and this one delivers although not near as much as ""Storm Warning"" which I watched yesterday. Also, for the most part the acting is good and although special effects aren't the best I have seen much, much worse in some very good films.

I think there are too many people who vote on these films that don't even like the genre. If you don't like Sci-Fi/Horror then why watch it. If you do like them then watch this one on a rainy afternoon with someone squeamish. Half the fun of watching some of these movies is to see the other persons reaction anyway. :)

Five men abducted by aliens and only 4 survive. Years later 3 are still trying to find these aliens again to get retribution. One man has tried to move on with his life. One night the 3 finally capture an alien and take him back to the fourth survivors house. He wants no part of it. He had been kept the longest than the rest and has some secrets of his own.

This might have been better as a horror/comedy because it does come very close without ever crossing that line. There is some gore although mild to moderate for those of us who have seen the ""Saw"" films. It isn't dark in mood or theme and doesn't have a message so I would consider it light entertainment for lovers of the horror genre.",6
86,"I would rate it 8.5/10.

For those who love a great horror movie which has a fair bit of blood then this is for you. Its about a group of guys (some of which get killed) trying to restrain and fight this alien.

Some parts are quite gross and not for viewers who vomit easily. The rating (at least in Australia) doesn't see blood and gore but don't be fooled! It does a great job in scaring you. Even those who have watched the Exorcist and say it isn't scary at all (like me) will probably be scared by this one.

I really enjoyed Altered and is one of my favorite horror films.",8
87,"A group of men kidnap an alien in retaliation for treatment inflicted on them by aliens years before.

This indie horror gem shows the aftermath of the kidnapping, the tensions between the men, the back story, the repeated efforts by the alien to escape. The suspense keeps getting ratcheted up from the beginning to the end, and you're never quite sure where it's going.

Good special effects, good acting, excellent production values, all is as it should be here. This is the kind of movie you are always trying to find in the bargain bin; an overlooked horror flick that has transcended it's budget by means of sheer originality.

There are lots of movies about aliens kidnapping people. This is the first one I've ever seen about people kidnapping an alien. That alone should tell you what you need to know. Watch it, you won't be sorry.",8
88,"From the co-writer and director of Blair Witch, this movie is much better than I expected! It has a good, creepy score and good cinematography. The story is also good. This movie deserved a lot more promotion/marketing. Three drinking buddies spend years in the woods seeking to capture an alien who was among those who'd violated them in the past. (Spoiler Warning) After they capture the alien scout and throw it in their van, they transport it to a garage where a scenario not unlike the Reservoir Dogs develops. Altered is a surprise find, well worth the time even if one of the characters is a bit hard to watch. Few alien movies have such a good story. This well-directed film has good effects, unusual sets and an interesting use of lighting. Better than expected and a probable cult classic!",9
89,"I didn't really expected as good as it was,it is surprisingly good for a low budget Sci-Fi movie.Actually the movie is good for the ones who believe ALIENS ARE OUT THERE and basically the movie plays with this concept.there wasn't much of a story or action but hats of to the Director and the Special effects guys,they keep you watching the movie somehow. One Major drawback the movie has is that its all very dark,and after watching the movie if u think about it it can easily be a PART TWO of a movie,the reason i said that is because of all of the history of the characters they are talking about.sometimes u feel that the events of the past which they are talking about might have been good if they show some on screen.Over all its an OK movie and u can see and enjoy it Once.",4
90,"This is without a doubt the best horror movie i've seen in the last 10 years, and i've seen hundreds of em'.. this movie was just the bomb, it was totally new , and refreshing, an idea that really hasn't been explored before in movies,, also the creature,, ""alien"" design on this one, was top notch,, this alien looked so different from almost every other movie i've ever seen,, the cast of characters are all new to me,, so i didn't have any false pretensions going in,, as to what to expect from certain actors, and actresses. the plot line was just so wonderful,, the camera angles, the scares,, there was even some funny comedy from the sheriff too, where he has a beer while investigating a call at our main characters' place, overall i can't find anything wrong with this film,, if i could rate it a 13 on here i would, it's easily the best horror in 10 years, maybe more,, i'm that serious. you can tell it's from the same guys that made Blair Witch,, big thumbs up here best movie of 06 for sure, way to go Haxan Films,, for a good job,, definitely well done,, love ya guys.",10
91,"when i saw that the movie was created by the director of ""Blair Witch"" i bought it. but later i found out that it has nothing to do with the director of ""Blair witch"" as the cover claims. But i decided to watch anyway because i had spent money on it (£4.99). summary: Fifteen years ago, five men were abducted by aliens. Only four returned. Now, these same four men have managed to capture one of the creatures who killed their friend and ruined their lives. It's time for payback but payback swings both ways. Here is my opinion. the movie was terrible. the acting was terrible and the special effects made it hard to watch. I honestly gave up halfway through the film because i was so bored. so if your looking for a frightening night, don't let the cover fool you into buying it save your money for a better movie. score: 3/10",3
92,"I'm a big fan of ""The Blair Witch Project"", and I've been trying to watch the other movies made by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. So far, this is undoubtedly the best out of them all, and one that makes me eagerly anticipate Sanchez' next movie, ""Seventh Moon"".

This is low budget, but intelligently made. I don't want to give anything away, as the best thing about this movie is never knowing for sure what is going to happen, and then something interesting happens.

This is as much a science-fiction movie as a horror, and it's incredible how much tension and curiosity this movie generates throughout its duration. The ending is perfect and almost suggests a sequel. I even found myself midly obsessed with the subject matter for a few days after watching this movie, even though I'd never taken an interest in it before.

Sorry Myrick, but this was much better than ""Believers"" and ""Solstice"" lumped together, so Sanchez easily wins this round. Hopefully this movie will get the attention it deserves in a few years time - I believe it will become a cult classic.

8/10",8
93,"I rented this from Netflix because I have always have had a strong interest in UFOs. I didn't expect much from it, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The blurb for the movie almost tells too much, the movie itself starts with 3 rural looking folk hunting an alien in the woods. The movie really starts when they catch one - just what do they do with it? That's what the movie deals with, coping with the captured alien and revealing the back-story. Rather than using flashbacks, the back-story is told in bits & pieces in regular conversation. You kind of have to piece things together yourself, which I found to be fun. But even by the end, you'll still be wondering about a lot of things.

The acting was really good (except the female lead), as was the characterization. To a certain extent the characters were stereotypes, but at the same time, they were believable ones. And for that matter, likable, which always ups the tension in a horror movie, because you start to care about the characters.

The special effects were also quite good for its presumed budget. Some were pretty gruesome. Also a whole lot of use of bad language, but largely in a believable way.

There are some plot holes, I think, and it's not something you'd want to watch over and over. But very much worth watching once.",7
94,"""It's bound to get ugly"" --Cody in ""Altered""

Eduardo Sanchez definitely proves that the promise he showed with the indy classic ""Blair Witch"" was no fluke. In fact, this is a better film than ""Blair"": with a bigger budget and the mans to provide the payoff to the graphic and suggestive scares, ""Altered"" is lean and savage entry int he Alien Horror genre. No stick figures and rock smashing in this one.

(Few Spoilers)

""Altered"" starts in high-gear and doesn't relent. A trio of Good Old Boys, once abducted and tortured by nasty extraterrestrials, finally turn the table after 7 years, and nab one of the ETs. Out of their depth, and expecting imminent alien reprisals, they take refuge with the reluctant Wyatt (Adam Kaufman), who has some interesting connections to, and defenses against the interstellar hostiles. Of course, the captured alien has his own abilities and agenda...

I really enjoyed this movie, from the tight direction and scripting to the performances, especially Kaufman as a man still torn by grief over the death of a friend, and the inner suffering due to the physical and mental anguish suffered at the hands of the aliens. One of the really fine things about this film, is that Sanchez' ETs are truly vile and sadistic critters, and the make-up effects are assisted by some good editing/lighting to take full advantage of the monsters.

The best thing about the film, however, is the ensemble playing by the former abductees turned abductors: the sharp screenplay is good at showing you how wounded and embittered these guys are, and when the group dynamic starts to disintegrate, you feel the sense of loss and sorrow that still haunts these guys.

Psychological and physical horror abound: there is one ""gut-check"" of a gag-inducing tug-of-war between the heroes and the alien that will definitely have gore-hounds cheering, and there's a nasty alien bite infection that rates with a similar plot element in another horror sleeper, ""Feast."" Still, the violence and gore is abetted by tense talking-heads stuff that never slows the story down and the movie has the odd riveting image here and there: the graceful ascent of a jellyfish-like spaceship against the full moon; the ""clicker"" alien prey tagging devices are a clever touch.

There may have been a few too many 'Dad-Gummits"" and F____, but these are quibbles. This is tight, good, scary fun. Anyhow, you got to love a film where a mortally wounded secondary character waves off the offer of aid with a terse< ""Just give me a beer!"" I can't wait for Sanchez' next film.",7
95,"I thought this movie was decent although I'll have to agree with at least two of the prominent complaints, one being that while the plot was reasonably original, it's execution was a little... ""meh."" If that's a reasonable way to describe it. It seemed like a long way to go to end up at the place that everyone (save one) had intended to be at the beginning. In fact, as someone has already pointed out, they really just wanted to kill one of them out of revenge and possibly alert the world to an invasion or at the very least get someone to believe that they weren't crazy after all. And the sole argument against killing the alien was that not only would it bring others but it would start what the protagonist refers to as an ""massacre"" (I think). But not only do they kill that alien but blow up a crap load of them at the end. And then drive off into the sunset. But only after everyone else is thoroughly slaughtered for leaving their fates in the hands of... well... a wuss (aka the protagonist).

I think a lot of people hate this movie because nobody likes to feel like they've wasted their time. And what happens in this movie is basically a lot of blood being shed pointlessly only to find out that really, the only course of action was the one they intended to take at the beginning. Watching someone be indecisive for an entire movie and get everyone killed only to smile into the camera and drive off into the sunset with his girlfriend like it's all good kind of sucks. Well, actually, it REALLY sucks.

I can't say the directing or acting was bad. But the story felt kind of lacking. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a round of Intestine Tug O War, but I'd rather it have been a byproduct of matters that couldn't be helped rather than mere wussiness. The hero pisses me off... that guy was soooooo indecisive. But he was quick to blow up that house...

One other complaint (which also happens to deal with my favorite part of the movie): that spaceship kicked a$$, but what is up with buck naked aliens with no weapons or any technology save their ship? I mean, obviously, they can be shot and burned, so at what point were we supposed to believe that they were capable of ""massacring"" the human race? I didn't see any sign of a death ray, or a forcefield. Yeah, they have mind control, but that can obviously be solved with a bullet to the head, or a harpoon to the abdomen. And if they were that advanced... why not just abduct those guys instead of running around the forest on foot like deer or something?",7
96,"Four friends in the deep south (or so I guess by their accents), face their fears and the past that haunts them. The result is a movie that has much depth and suspension than the average straight to DVD movie.

Brothers Duke (Brad William Henke), Cody (Paul McCarthy Boyington), and Otis (Michael C. Williams) accomplish what they thought they would never be able to do. They trap one of the aliens that abducted them 15 years earlier and killed their brother. The problem that comes next is what to do next. A quick decision by Duke sends them towards their one time childhood friend Wyatt (Adam Kaufman) who was also with them during the abduction years earlier. More so, he is the only one that ""they"" seemed most interested in.

However, Wyatt upon learning of their capture wants nothing to do with the brothers or their capture. A paranoid who lives in a remote home surrounded by flood lights and with doors that can be locked various times, he himself has dealt with the abduction in his own way. Bringing them back to him is the last thing that he or his girlfriend Hope (Catherine Mangan) want. Even if they were the reason for the death of his best friend, Wyatt has done his best to move on.

Wyatt though becomes the center of the story as we discover that the aliens do have a certain desire for him even though we never fully know why that it is. He received an implant and somehow the ability to sense them. During the final confrontation with the alien that Duke and his brothers captured, it appears that Wyatt himself has mental powers which he uses to cripple the alien. Again we find no explanation though we can guess that the past abduction gave him powers which he used.

The conflict that fills Altered is not so much the alien vs man story that we are used to after years of sci movies. What makes Altered interesting is the relationship between four friends and how they dealt with an experience that only brought shame and ridicule. Much of Altered consists of conversations about the past and what was done and what should have been done. This is especially so between Wyatt and Cody where the latter especially feels remorse because of the belief that his father blamed him for the death of his brother. Hope herself also constantly bemoans any attempt to bring the past back into the present and struggles to understand why such aliens would show such interest in Wyatt in the first place.

The most important lines come at the very end of the movie. As Hope and Wyatt flee, she asks how safe they are now that they killed perhaps a dozen of their kind. Wyatt can only say that they will have to wait and see.

97,"Aliens are always abducting people. From the trailer park to the state park people always seem to get taken away and come back with a story of something probing them....you know what I mean!!! However in this tale the abductees are the ones doing the abducting as a group of former alien test subjects capture an alien and begin to do their own probing in Altered.

Altered, which is directed by ""The Blair Witch Projects"" own Eduardo Sanchez, deals with a group of friends who were abducted and experimented on. During their experiments 3 of the men are sent back to earth while 2 others are experimented on further. One dies and the other is experimented on until finally he is released with a tracking device embedded in his intestines.

Flashing forward several years all the guys lives have been forever changed and one,Wyatt, has completely isolated himself having done alittle self surgery removing the tracking device that was embedded in him. One night the other abductees show up at Wyatt's door with an alien in tow that they have captured from the same sight that they were abducted many years ago. Little do they know the alien and his buddies have big plans for them...including Wyatt.

""Abducted"" hit all cylinders running from the get go and other than a few momentary lapses does not let up and makes for one of the better alien abduction or even alien movies I've seen in quite awhile. I've always had a blueprint in my mind of how to make a solid effective horror movie and darn if ""Altered"" doesn't follow it. Good story: check, No cheesy One-Liners: check, No to Limited CGI: check, Solid gore scenes, Check.

In this one my monster movie fans you will be happy to know that crappy CGI is avoided instead using good old fashion guy (or in this films case woman) in a suit to play the alien. Also No crappy one liners helps the film keep its edge and not go the way of so many so-called horror movies and steer into corniness. Gore hounds will like this one as well as there is a few nice scenes of gore and sinisterness from the alien as well as a guy who slowly begins to decay away after getting bit by the critter. Not a lot of gore mind you but when things are shown they are rather gruely.

Not just that but we even get a very solid ending that could have made or broke the review on this one. As you can see I have a lot of praise for this film. Why this wasn't marketed for a theatrical release is beyond me but oh well such is the nature of the business. Monster fans and Horror fans alike should check this out ASAP as this is a definite keeper.

7/10: Good, Do I have to say anymore, go check this one out it is a fun ride with very little humor and a lot of tension, as far as creature feature/alien movies go. Director Sanchez proves that he does have talent and Im definitely interested in seeing whats next on his plate.

That's it for now my peoples until next time please remember Aliens do not make good house pets...heck they don't even make a pet period...Im out!!!",7
98,"Man, I LOVE digital cable and movies on demand. I end up renting movies I would probably never pick up at the video store simply because it's so convenient. This movie was damn good, amazing for a low budget horror flick.

It had a novel approach in the way it started somewhere in the middle of the chronology of the story arc. It takes you a while to get enough backstory to understand what is going on but once you do you're hooked. The acting was very good and the pacing was relentless, almost like a James Cameron action flick. You can't go to the bathroom without missing a vital part of the movie, so much happens during the film.

The MAKEUP and EFFECTS were far, far beyond a small budget movie. Whoever designed them is obviously going to be regularly employed in Hollywood. The alien suit while obviously worn by a human was excellent! The manner of death for one of the humans was something I've never seen in a movie before, you'll understand when you see it.

I wish I could run across more movies like these but you've got to kiss a thousand frogs before you find a prince, I guess.",9
99,"I will pick one random movie off the shelf at the rental place at least once a month hoping that I will get lucky and see a decent low budget flick. 9 times out of 10 the movies suck. I had not heard of Altered but I can sit through any low budget sci-fi/horror flick that has an interesting well developed story even when special effects and acting are horrible.

That being said, I watched this movie and loved it!!. The alien was creepy as crap even before you could see it. When you finally see the little bugger it is pretty damn sweet looking. Not cheesy in any way and no horrible to look at CGI crap. It looked like a living critter that would scare the crap out of anyone that saw it. Unlike most cheap modern monster movies they actually show the critter for more than a few seconds at a time!!!!! You can actually look at it without eh camera darting around or shaking!!!!!! WOW!!! The acting wasn't great but was way better than average. Lots of interesting gory deaths and jump out of your seat scares. I loved it! It would have been nice to see a little more character development but who cares! I loved this movie and was probably one of the best movies of its kind that I have seen in a very long time.

101,"Altered is about a group of country boys getting even with an alien. The boys go out hunting for aliens that terrorized them and catch one much to their own dismay. They bring the alien to Wyatt's house and find that Wyatt has some special immunity. The rest of the movie is their efforts to survive the night while keeping the captured alien alive. Apparently if the boys kill one alien the rest will come back and 'put down' the whole human race. In the mean time they do a good job of cutting the alien up. The chic is the only smart one. The movie was filmed almost entirely in the dark, but they did a really good job of using lighting effects to allow it to be dark, but still see the action. The film started out very corny and slow, but by the end it had some very good scenes and special effects. You need to watch the whole film.",8
102,"Altered was a tight action-packed thrill ride. . . if by tight you actually mean loose and fluid plot with no real forethought put into the script. If by action-packed you mean ridiculous, drawn out, boring dialog and mediocre action scenes mostly of southern guys yelling at each other and cursing. . . a lot! If by thrill ride you mean predictably dull then this is the movie for you.

Okay, seriously the special effects aren't bad, and it wasn't terribly low budget, however, there are long periods of time where nothing happens and most of the movie takes place in two rooms of a house, where nothing happens. There is essentially no character development, so you never really care about what happens to any of the characters, let alone like any of them. Plus all of the characters are as dumb as bricks. The movie attempts a few heartwarming scenes which fall flat.

It's not a bad idea for a sci-fi thriller, but the execution does not deliver, mostly because of the conflict prone group of bumpkins that make the movie tedious to watch and the slow moving lumbering pace of the film. Better editing and a better script would have made a real difference. So, in fact it would have made it a different movie altogether.

All in all, don't waste your time. Watch a different movie.",3
103,"Horror and sci-used to be a great combination, but aliens are no longer scary. This movie does a good job at rekindling that. My only critique is that I wish there was more to the movie. A ratting of 5 means it was worth seeing but only once. 6 is worth seeing again, but isn't that great. I gave this a 7 because it's worth seeing again and was well done.",7
104,A truly entertaining and Underrated Sci fi/Horror film that rarely has a dull moment. Well worth a watch!,9
105,"I picked this up in a horror 4 pack and watched it without knowing anything about it. Movie started when I hit play, didn't even have a menu screen to spoil anything. What a pleasant surprise!

To start, you're introduced to characters who all have ""show, don't tell"" introductions. You don't get a lot of ""this guy is this, this guy is this"", you get character interaction and dialog, and character actions, with hints of a backstory that you piece together as the movie goes on.

There's a lot that happened in the past with these characters, and as each scene progresses, we learn a bit more. It's never entirely clear what all happened until we're close to the end, and even then, we don't fully know - there are no clear flashbacks, only descriptions that the audience can piece together.

There are one or two ""horror movie bad decisions"", including characters who get worked up about something they really don't need to at the time, but most of that is still close to in character enough that you can forgive it.

It's not the best movie ever, but for a movie with just a couple locations, a few actors, and pretty tight script, it does well.

Bonus points for having Yuengling beer in the movie and country characters who feel like real people. Big Hollywood tends to portray everyone from ""flyover country"" in as gross a stereotype as possible, and Altered is a delightful exception.",9
106,"Eduardo Sanchez, co-director of the big 1999 hit ""The Blair Witch Project"", returned with this rather effective low budget sci-fi / horror creature feature. The story involves three grown men who, 15 years previous, had been abducted by aliens and subjected to various tests. All this time later, the men want revenge, and manage to trap one of the creatures. They bring it to the isolated abode of an associate who had received the same treatment, but somehow he'd not suffered the same effects as them. He also has some sort of telepathic link with this species, and he knows that if his three buddies succeed in killing the creature, it will only make matters worse.

""Altered"" is a pretty inventive B picture that manages to overcome the limits of its budget. It's well paced - it certainly hits the ground running - and delivers an impressive amount of suspense and atmosphere. Its gore and monster FX are also quite good, with an impressively ugly & gnarly alien design, an old school approach that means you have actors in costumes, and some utterly fantastic gross-out moments. (For one thing, the result if a person is *bitten* by one of these things is a long, drawn-out disintegration process.) There's also a real economy in that the action doesn't require very much in the way of locations. It's mostly confined to Wyatts' (TV veteran Adam Kaufman, 'Without a Trace') hideaway in the woods.

As a bonus, the acting is better than one would expect: Brad William Henke ('Orange is the New Black') is ringleader Duke, Paul McCarthy-Boyington (""The Human Race"") is volatile ex-jailbird Cody, Michael C. Williams (Mike in ""The Blair Witch Project"") is the timid Otis, Catherine Mangan (""Otis E."") is Wyatts' perplexed girlfriend Hope, and the late, great character actor James Gammon (""Major League"") is a welcome presence as the local Sheriff who responds to a 911 call. Joe Unger (""Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III"") has a funny cameo at the end. Kaufman is solid as the protagonist who has always dreaded this scenario.

Best of all, the story does have something of a sense of humour, but has the actors still play it straight. The scene with the intestines is proof of this.

""Altered"" is definitely worth a look for dedicated genre enthusiasts.

Seven out of 10.",7
107,"It was very suspenseful and besides the fact that the alien is a very scary looking thing, it has some gore that is memorable, to say the least. A good plot and since I didn't like Blair Witch project, I wasn't expecting it to be very good. However to my surprise, it was a very well done and creepy movie. Worth watching for anyone who likes alien movies.",8
108,"Three overly stereo-typical rural southern citizens are out hunting an alien one night. Why this night of all nights is not known, but they are. And sure enough they find one and manage to subdue and chain it. They take the alien to their friend Wyatt (Adam Kaufman) in the wee hours of the morning. They too have sustained injury. The film mostly take place in the garage with a limited number of people. However, that doesn't take away from the horror or intensity which was done quite well. It seems the alien isn't going to just lie there.

As most rural southerns, this wasn't their first encounter with an alien.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",8
109,"I appreciate that this movie comes out nearly 13 years ago. For its day it would have scored higher from me. I loved the idea. At first some things appear contradictory, but they tend to resolve by the end (not necessarily a good point though). It's all very rough and tumble, with many scenes of over reaction, and these people aren't teens. These days the humanoid alien would have needed more for a movie to be successful. With the exception of Shape of Water (imagine a inverted horror version of that movie, where the creature is the bad guy), to my mind, if you are going to feature a lot of an alien, then it has to have something really extreme going for it, thus good cgi (think Alien) would work, or at least something really eye-popping, such as the symbiosis of tech and ugliness that is Predator. This movie reminded me of Feast. The scenario is similar, though this movie had some more sophisticated quirks due to the altered nature of a prior abductee, and wasn't such a blood fest. The action featured a lot of jumping on people gone nuts, or the alien got loose. Some of the infection angle was gruesome, and the various tricks and abilities of the alien kept things fresh. There's a couple of instances of gore, both are too exaggerated for my liking. Yet despite these criticisms, the movie tied together as a whole, had good performances, certainly had spark, and was given enough tension, action and originality to make it a fun matinee.",7
110,"There's something altogether creepy about this sub genre. A foreign entity invading your life without warning and no way of knowing how to kill it. And probably why, in my opinion, this is one of the strongest sub genres in horror. Yes it can oftentimes be overly campy but get the right ingredients and it's an experience like no other.

Altered (2006)

Being honest the first time I watched this I wasn't bowled over by it, only on a second viewing did it start to worm under my skin and ever since it's become a personal favourite of mine.

Synopsis: Fifteen years ago, a group of men's lives were forever changed by a strange occurrence. Now, the same group of men will spend a night together... in terror.

What I really enjoy about this film is that it's not the same old ""hunt, be killed"" scenario as it begins much differently from usual alien fare, suffice to say this is a film that for a large portion is more character driven.

Both Brad Henke as Duke and Paul McCarthy-Boyington as Cody in their respective roles do a fantastic job with special emphasis on Henke: a typical tough man yet there's both a warmth and sense of intelligence to him.

But ah Adam Kaufman... eagle eyed viewers of Buffy will recognise him as Parker from season 4, an egotistical driven idiot; so seeing him in this was odd not least of all because he's really the soul of Altered. As Wyatt he's outstanding. Both jaded after a dark past and the voice of reason on many an occasion.

The actors are truly the driving vehicle of this film and do a stellar job I feel without being ridiculously hammy.

And that isn't to say this isn't creepy! During the second half of this film, the tension ratchets up considerably and with plenty of dark hollow spaces; dimmed rooms... you feel as helpless as the characters.

The effects are FANTASTIC and nicely old school, especially the main creature. Could it have been shown a little less? Perhaps, yet it doesn't detract from how gooey, disgusting and deliciously outstanding the SFX are with a killer ending that's blackly humorous.

Eduardo Sanchez has neatly crafted an alien film that's packed with gut wrenching intensity, good characters and a quiet unnerve that burns throughout the entire of Altered.

I can't praise this film highly enough, it marries all the elements needed to make a good horror and does so neatly, deserving a much coveted spot in the alien sub section of horror.",8
111,"This is one of those films that I think largely slipped under the radar and was even a bit panned at the time it came out. While it's far from being perfect it is a very enjoyable film. I prefer films like Fire in The Sky, The 4th Kind, and even Signs over this, but it isn't too far behind those. In a lot of ways, those four films lumped together would make for one hell of a mini-marathon session.

The technical aspects are all very solid. The cinematography, score, and acting all work very well. There are several shots in the movie that are breathtaking with the way they are lit and the atmosphere they throw off. The FXs in this are pretty damn awesome. If you're a fan of practical FXs work you will definitely appreciate it.

The one area where this one loses some points with me is the story itself. While I liked the story I felt like they missed a bit of chance to delve deeper into each character's background. We get hints, but it never really feels like it's fleshed out to full potential. It also feels like it just ends rather abruptly. While it's not a horrible ending, it could have been so much more. I wanted to see something more intense.

Overall, this is one I continue to enjoy and throw on every handful of years. If you've never seen this one and like Alien Abduction type flicks, you should track it down and give it a watch.

My Rating: 5.5/10",6
112,"Great action that starts from the beginning and lasts to the end. The Alien is wicked. I don't want to give anything away, but I wasn't expecting much from a low budget movie of this genre. I was pleasantly surprised! This movie reinforced my thought that characters played by actors who can carry their weight wrapped up in a great storyline will make for a wonderful movie. This movie proves that! This movie was a lot of fun! Don't let it get away!",10
113,"This movie exceeded my expectations. The special effects and creature design was also pretty impressive considering the budget. It's more of a cult classic film rather than a mainstream audience pleaser.

Overall, it is recommended to anyone looking to have a good watch for a casual night.",7
114,"Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, ""Altered"" is an unconventional alien abduction movie. Here a band of foul-mouthed rural folk, all of whom have been repeatedly abducted by extra-terrestrials, concoct a plan to vengefully capture and torture an alien.

""Altered's"" first half unfolds like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", mixing gritty realism with paranormal suspense. Its second half then indulges in much gore, blood and violence. Because our human victims have been so abused, so psychologically altered by their abductions, this violence seems almost cathartic. The film's ancestor seems to be ""I Spit on Your Grace"", an infamous rape-and-revenge movie.

7.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",
115,"OK so here is the skinny,

This film is excellent, believable characters, great special effects and a solid storyline. But not for the fans of modern age cinema, and I will tell you why. Now we have entire films created on blue screen, digital effects create vast universes to the point that soon there wont be any need for real actors or what is now considered ""old skool"" special/makeup effects.

This film is for fans of things like original X-files episodes, and films like American Werewolf in London. It actually feels like one of those gripping X-files episodes, you didn't get many back in the day when it was at its hight of popularity but occasionally there were episodes that had you at the edge of your seat and pulled you in. This is one of those.

It's horror, sci-fi, and drama rolled into one. It has a small feeling of hearkening back to films like Stand By Me, and IT. Using the dynamic of grown men who had a tormenting childhood and or significant event which changed them forever.

A great film almost passed by in the horror scene and definitely well worth the watch.",8
116,"The aliens in this sci-fi horror flick do it all: control your mind and make you attack your friends, deliver flesh-eating viruses, plant bony, Cronenberg-esque tracking devices in your intestines, and just flat-out, violently attack you. From a distance, they look like men in green rubber suits, but up close they are intricate, disgusting, scary, and best of all, not CG.

This movie has enough to please all types of horror fans. Although most of the fear it delivers is in the form of tension -- both from the aliens and from human anger -- it does contain some truly graphic scenes. The rotting flesh and intestine dismantling will please any splatter fan. The only thing that prevented this movie from being great is that I never found much reason to care about any of the characters.",7
117,"The movie caught my attention in the first 5 minutes as it opens with 3 of the main characters running through the woods chasing and hunting something assumed to be an animal. However, small glimpses later reveal that it's not an animal.

The men have set out to seek revenge and eventually become the prey themselves. I thought this movie was really good and had some scary elements to it.

If you like sci-fi horror films, this is a must see for you. I would actually watch it again and I definitely recommend you see it too! You will be entertained all the way through the movie.",9
118,"Altered is one of these films that doesn't let you rest for a minute. It's 84 minutes of action packed Sci-Fi/Horror.

The film starts with a disturbing static sound that made me turn down the volume, as it was painful to listen to, felt like the sound was in my head. Immediately after, we're cast into a chase where 3 men are hunting... something. Something agile, vicious, powerful and not human. As the film continues, the intense dialogues between the characters reveal the story of an alien abduction, and what life was afterwards for the four survivors. Only then does the true genius artistic meaning of the static noise become apparent... By far one of the best uses of sound I've ever come across in horror films. The music is also great and sets the stressful eerie mood of the film. The audio was, in my opinion, the best part.

The story is one of the more original ones when it comes to aliens, realistic enough to keep suspense of disbelief and fantastic enough to be intriguing and compelling. Even the gore parts weren't the usual closeups of dismembered organs, but far more original and far more gruesome. I'm really not a gore fan, but I had to appreciate these scenes.

The only let-down for me were the aliens themselves. I realize the movie wasn't a high budget Hollywood blockbuster, and it made out for its lack of budget in originality, good acting, great makeup and superb audio effects. However, the aliens simply looked like big dolls/action figures. Nothing as realistic as the ones in Alien and Predator.

Besides that, the whole ""horror"" part of the film simply didn't come through. While a great sci-fi/action/thriller, Altered was hardly a horror film.

All in all - not as genuinely horrifying as Fourth Kind and way way better than The Dream Catcher. If you ask me, it's definitely underrated, and definitely worth watching.",7
119,"Fifteen years ago, a group of men's lives were forever changed by a strange occurrence. Now, the same group of men will spend a night together... in terror.

This film had been talked up to me for many years and I have considered picking it up for at least two years now. I have not, but I did find it on Netflix and gave it a peek. I liked it. Greatest film ever? No. But pretty decent just the same -- action, suspense, great makeup and gore effects.

I feel bad that Eduardo Sanchez has ""Blair Witch Project"" holding him down. While it was a badge of honor at the time, the film has since become a scorned film by horror fans and Sanchez has suffered because of it. Move on, people! Watch ""Altered"" and judge it without his record. Watch his other films... Sanchez is with up for the long haul.",7
120,"I fired this one up on Netflix while I was busy with some writing. It looked and sounded like it would be something good for background noise while I tried to focus on more important things. Surprisingly, it ended up being a decently fun movie!

The acting is mediocre, as one can imagine. There isn't much to be noted as particularly memorable in most regards (with the exception of the scene that I won't spoil, but anyone who's seen this will know what it is *shiver* soooo creepy!), but it definitely has a ""cheap sci-fi"" charm to it.

While not my favorite movie of all time, I made my husband watch it and I've watched it a few times since that first afternoon. If I ever happen to come across it in a store, you can bet I'll be grabbing it up without a second thought. It won't hurt you to check it out as long as your primary preference isn't ""big budget"" or ""witty and clever."" Go ahead, give it a try.",7
121,"Well, this film begins very courageous. In most films, we get to slowly know the characters, so as the film progresses, things begin to happen. Eduardo Sanchez is a brave director that had the guts to make it different. Things are already happening in the first scene and we get to know the characters and the story as the film goes. This kind of strategy is more enjoyable for those who can easily pay attention to a film; if you start thinking about other things while watching, you'll be lost in the story and bored to death. I have nothing to complaint about the plot; ""Altered"" has a perfect running time and never disappoints. The creature is pretty creepy and its moaning is even creepier. The actors, thought being very unknown, are all professional in their job. I just think it'd be better if it had a greater development and more aliens. I don't know why I'm refusing to give it more than 6.",6
122,"Altered is a fine example of an ""extra-terrestrial thriller"" done right, especially considering their budget limitations. There's nothing hokey or campy about it. The Fx's are done well, the performances are convincing, the directing is far better than is to be expected. This film out does many big-name, big-budget productions of its kind. The alien character was great, very nicely done. I found all the characters to be believable and multi-dimensional, which is hardly ever seen in these types of films. I was engaged in the story and the action from beginning to end. A back-story is definitely there, but it never stumbles stupidly at the audiences face. Someone working this film realized that there are going to be people watching other than dopey adderall-laced 14 year old boys, about time! So for the adult sci-fi lover in you, treat yourself to this little jewel of a movie.",7
123,"What you get here, from the guy who brought you the Blair Witch Project- a clever and effective flick in my opinion, is a claustrophobic monster movie taking alien abduction as its premise. Better than most other such attempts, like Fire in the Sky, this film is not going to shed light on the UFO phenomenon or change the way we think about life like Descartes but it does provide fun and thrills. The director is effective at creating tension and the whole cast is reasonably convincing. Aside from the ridiculous monster, a muscular green dwarf with nasty teeth and a vagina-like orifice in its head (what is up with that?), the camera work and gross effects are better than average for a low budget monster picture. None of this stuff is a spoiler, by the way, because you get all this info in the first 15 minutes. Recommended for fun.",5
124,To be honest i really wasn't expecting this to be a movie i would thoroughly enjoy...but i was very mistaken..from the start the film throws you into the action and it definitely has all the thrills and spills to satisfy todays movie viewers. Although the sci-fi aspect and the whole 'alien' hunting scenario didn't really have any uniqueness about it..as a few other titles are very similar in scenarios and plots..a title which came to mind for my while watching this was 'John Gulager's' 'Feast'...I will let you guys figure out why if you watch the two...but overall this movie did what it says on the box..its has superb acting from 'Adam Kaufman' and 'James Gammon' in particular..and it was also directed by 'Eduardo Sanchez' who brought us 'The Blair Witch Project' which i thought was a classic. This is a must-see ;) check it out..,8
125,"As noted on the cover, from the director of Blair Witch. Mostly when something like that is written you will have some piece of trash in your hands. But look here, this is something to watch. It's all about aliens on earth, there is no explanation why they are here on earth or why they search for that one guy, but I can tell, time flies as watching this flick. It is never boring even that there are just a few actors in it. They are all believable. The storyline is okay, the make up is okay and the special affects are okay. The alien is also believable and the gore is intact. It isn't bloody at all but the transformation of the guy is nicely done. Of course they made an open end suspecting that it would be a classic like BWP. But that will never be, the scares aren't enough available. You sure will like this one if you're just entering the scene of SF horror.",6
126,"Title says it all. I enjoyed this movie, going into it realizing that it was not going to be a movie that I would probably be watching again.

On the low side, the plot was barely explained and the fear of the power of the aliens seemed lame as the aliens were running around naked in the wilderness.

On the high side, there was plenty of scenes with a badass alien doing lots of damage to the cast which was humorous due to the quality of the acting. Personally, I wasn't exactly attached to the characters so I could sit back and watch the havoc that ensued throughout the movie.

All in all, this is not a quality movie, but its rather entertaining if you like the genre (and isn't entertainment really the point?).",5
127,"Made on a low budget it managed to pull off what others could not.Ran a bit slow at times but the suspense is definitely there in bundles; good acting all round separates it from the droves of alien abduction films. The film also goes out it's way to avoid the clichés that usually abound in these films and instead reverses the abduction situation, where it is the alien has been captured (and tortured slightly). Downside were plot holes or lack of reasonable explanations set-out for the viewer, however if the large budget films put this much effort into a story we would see a rise in the quality of films all round. Go rent now.",7
128,"Whereas ""Blair Witch"" cemented its eternal cult classic standing through mood, keen peripheral knowledge of its setting and a mythic storyline, ""Altered"" exposes Eduaord's fallacies as a director. The cheap budget and stiff direction are felt throughout the moments of dialogue. Whereas Heather Donahue was given ample opportunities to showoff a resolute resourcefulness, this female character is completely disposable and wasted. However, kudos should be given to the makeup crew, where it looks like the majority of the budget was spent. That green alien, though structurally generic, was massively mean. Also, the 'Leviathanesque' alteration of some of the supporting characters was sickening. However, it is not suspenseful or scary enough to merit a watch.",4
129,"I thought Altered was really good! It's a pretty simple plot: three hicks, who have been hunting aliens for seven years, finally catch one and take it to their friend's house. The friend, Wyatt, has had contact with the aliens before, having been abducted nearly fifteen years ago. Most of the hijinks involves these four guys Wyatt's girlfriend and the abducted alien. The story is sort of derivative, combining elements from Night of the Living Dead, the original Alien and maybe a dash of Signs. But this managed to take those pieces and still make a highly suspenseful film!

The characters were fleshed out just enough where you cared what happened to them. Honestly Adam Kaufman's Wyatt stole the show. The man has charisma. As for the rest, in this day and age where every horror character is a sassy b*tch, it was nice to see dialog that was restrained and functional. They still managed to sneak a few jokes in, but they were so subtle and/or situational that it worked pretty well. The only one who comes across as an amateur is the girlfriend. I've seen oak trees that were less wooden than her delivery. Still, considering this was a nobody, no publicity, nothing, straight to video indie flick I'm surprised at how good she was in comparison to other similar projects.

The special effects were pretty good. Everything was hand made special effects, so you don't have any of that fakey CGI smeared around. Movies ten times the budget haven't learned that lesson yet. The character design for the alien was pretty good. It sported an animatronic face and probably a small, athletic bloke in a rubber suit with the result being some of the best monster realism since Aliens. The best part was the disembowel scene. Realistic without being disgusting, a chuckling that's-gotta-hurt moment if I ever saw one. Really, this was a pleasant surprise, given where the sequel to the Blair Witch went. Maybe Eduardo Sanchez has a future in horror after all!",8
130,"This movie isn't for everyone, but if you like movies like FEAST, ABOMINABLE, SLITHER and THE DESCENT, then you're in for a treat! I give THE DESCENT (my favorite movie, last year) a slight edge, but I liked the faster paced ALTERED more than any other horror movie, of the past couple of years. No time is wasted getting started with the thrills.

I was impressed with Eduardo Sanchez's directing. I'm convinced that the creepy setup of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was no fluke! Some scenes with a welding mask are extremely effective, as are many others.

It's nice to see creature flicks done with physical effects and very little CGI. If you want CGI creatures, go watch VAN HELSING or THE MUMMY.

There are a couple of cliché things in ALTERED, but it's all scary and fun. The makeup effects are both good and over the top. Remember the short-lived alien flashback in A FIRE IN THE SKY? This movie gives you that terror, for the whole length of the movie.

Loved it!!!",8
131,"Warning: Major Spoilers in this review

Altered has an exciting beginning with three men pursuing an unknown creature through the woods at night. They finally trap their prey and take it to a fourth friend's house. The setup is ripe for an excellent movie, but the script begins to lose steam at about the 50 minute mark. While I found the acting good overall, given that the actors are not well known, and the alien looks terrific, the plot begins to become annoyingly repetitive at about the halfway point of the movie as we are forced to endure a lot of expository exchanges. The four buddies, and the girlfriend, bicker annoyingly over what should be done with the captive e.t. and the plot stops moving forward. By the time the sheriff makes an unwelcome visit, the movie almost grinds to a halt. The good news is that, shortly thereafter, the action does pick up with one of the most disturbingly graphic scenes I've witnessed in a while. The alien escapes and yanks out a handful of one of the men's intestines and slowly pulls them from his body. Well done indeed, it had me squirming in my seat. As the unlucky victim, Mike Williams (from Blair Witch Project) does a great job in this scene. My only complaint is that, as most of the movie is shot at night, in the woods, a van and in a house that has lost power, many of the scenes are a bit dark. While this does increase tension, at times it is simply annoying since it's often difficult to figure out what is going on. Also, the end feels rather abrupt, leaving some major questions unanswered. Like, what is going to happen with the sheriff's body in the back of the van and will Cody's father do anything with the charred alien corpse on his front step? Did no one notice the major explosion when Wyatt blew his house to hell? Not to mention that the alien invasion that our hero predicted seems to have been aborted or postponed. These quibbles aside, the effects are well done and I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a lower budget scare fest without pretensions that could have benefited from tighter scripting. 6.5 stars.",6
132,"So I have a place in my heart for crappy, direct-to-DVD horror flicks, (especially on a Saturday afternoon, w/a sufficient number of beers). This was the level of quality I was expecting when I rented ""Altered"" - about a group of good ol' boys whose long ago run-in with an alien comes full-circle in one bloody, stress-fest night fifteen years later. Boy was I wrong. The movie is all around well acted, w/good dialogue; the characters are engaging, and the creepy back-story of the mens' previous encounter is revealed organically, as the night unfolds. The monsters are creepy, and the gore is appropriately gory, but the movie (unlike so many throw-away, big budget horrors) doesn't rely solely on its monsters and its gore. Yay, movie. Why do flicks like this go straight to DVD, and dreck like The Grudge winds up in theaters??? Yeah - That was rhetorical.",9
133,"Three rednecks hunt and capture, what we soon learn to be, an alien. In an effort to hide out, they then pull the ol' ""drop in"" on one of their pal's and his girlfriend. Arguments, accusations, and gun-pointing ensue only to be followed by disemboweling, rotting of the skin, and some vicious biting.

This is the film Cabin Fever could have, dare I say, should have been. The tension kept me on edge and the acting was far better than I expected. It had its gruesome moments, but these did not cross over into the absurd. It's funny how a lot of these films miss out on effective advertising. A decent alien-horror flick.",7
134,"Except for a single scream, no one speaks above a hard whisper. Wind rustles through sugar cane fields guarded by a pop-eyed, nearly skeletal zombie who stands as lifeless and stick-shouldered as a scarecrow. A dead rabbit hangs in a tree. Voodoo drums thrum the night air.

""I Walked with a Zombie"" is a movie of such voluptuous atmosphere that if you surrender yourself to it, it almost seems as if you've been transported to another world. It's a horror movie of suggestion, inference, punctuated with the occasional visual just sharp enough to prick through the feeling of dread and send a chill up the spine.

All performances low-key and excellent (Frances Dee notably good), the dialog crisp, but it's the lighting, sets and camera work that make the movie what it is, a gorgeous vision of shadows that haunts the mind days later.

And it's only 69 minutes long.",10
135,"Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) is a Canadian nurse hired to come to the Caribbean island of St. Sebastian, to work at Fort Holland. There she will attend to the needs of the mute, unresponsive, yet seemingly alive Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon). Jessica is wife to a plantation owner named Paul Holland (Tom Conway), with whom Betsy falls in love. Betsy becomes determined to do the right thing by Paul by trying to cure her, if she can. That includes immersing herself in the local voodoo culture.

There may be modern horror fans who bemoan the lack of what one might consider horror in ""I Walked with a Zombie"". It starts to go for more of a traditional creep factor in its second half, using the imposing Darby Jones as the mysterious, zombified Carrefour to great effect. Everything is handled with a great deal of sensitivity and authenticity by screenwriters Curt Siodmak & Ardel Wray, producer Val Lewton, and director Jacques Tourneur. Unlike some of the horror product of the time, it actually treats its black characters with a great deal of dignity and respect, and also gives the actors a chance to shine, such as Theresa Harris as Alma the maid.

As was always the case with these Lewton productions, the story (based to some degree on Jane Eyre, with factual articles on voodoo in the West Endies also used as a basis) is pretty tight, and the running time is typically short. (69 minutes all told.) We don't get to know the characters all that well, but we do still like them, and in a refreshing touch, there are no clear cut villains or explanations for the strange events. The actors each do a solid job: Dee as the heroine, Conway as the husband, James Ellison as his half brother, Edith Barrett (in old age make-up) as their mother, James Bell as the doctor, and Sir Lancelot as the calypso singer. As one can see, some of the cast were regulars in these Lewton films.

Overall, there's a real feeling of sadness to the atmosphere, helping to make this one of the best of Lewtons' filmography. One wouldn't know from the end result how quickly and cheaply these productions were made, as they have the power to grip their viewers 70 plus years later.

Eight out of 10.",8
136,"""I Walked with a Zombie"", besides having one of the oddest movie titles, took a different approach to the horror genre than the popular Universal movies of the day. Maybe it harkens back to the earlier Universal heavies like ""Dracula"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". Made by Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur, they crafted their collaborations using a poetic, dreamlike approach to cinematic storytelling. Lyrical and atmospheric, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" recounts the story of a Canadian nurse sent to a small West Indian sugar island to tend for a young comatose woman, the wife of the island's plantation owner. What's wrong with her? Hints abound through the songs of the calypso singers, bits of dialogue, objects in the movie. The story, as odd as it is, is not told directly. You may think it is, but at the end of the film, you're not so certain of what's happened. Were the events the work of the supernatural? Was a crime committed? Or both? Or neither? It's difficult to say. I recommend this movie, it's important not to forget the older, off-beat films.",9
137,"The film opens with Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) being interviewed for a home-care nursing position. Oddly, she's asked during the interview if she believes in witchcraft. She gets the position, working for Paul Holland (Tom Conway), who is a wealthy plantation owner on the Caribbean island of St. Sebastian. Holland has hired her to take care of his wife, Jessica (Christine Gordon), who is in a perpetual state that resembles somnambulance. As Betsy spends more time on the island, she learns that most of the population believes in and practices voodoo, and she learns that Jessica had a relatively tumultuous past with Holland's family.

This was director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton's second horror/thriller collaboration (the first being Cat People (1942) and the third The Leopard Man (1943)). For many viewers, it is their favorite of the three. While I like the film, I don't like it quite that much--I prefer Cat People. But still, I Walked With A Zombie ends up with a 7 out of 10 from me.

The horror aspects of I Walked With A Zombie are really very minor. They're really present only as a kind of personification of the results of complicated romantic and familial relationships. Yes, there is an admirable ""haunted house""-styled scene involving a spooky stairway and creepy, distant sounds, and yes, the trek to the voodoo ""home fort"" is well done, but this kind of material doesn't work as well for me here as it did in Cat People, because here it's not really the focus of the story. It's ancillary material with the function of helping to solve a very different kind of mystery. Also, much of the voodoo material (such as the actual ceremony) tends to be overrated in my opinion, although the final sequence related to the voodoo theme is appropriately eerie.

But what works best for me in I Walked With A Zombie are the many dialogue-heavy scenes where the three main characters--Connell, Holland and Wesley Rand (James Ellison)--gradually learn more about one another, and where the ""mystery"" is gradually uncovered. A scene where a local ""minstrel"" sings part of the backstory while Connell and Rand are having a drink is exquisite, for example. Yet, even with this positive aspect, I never felt that the backstory was sufficiently explained. The mystery remains, and the moralizing bookends of the film do not help, either.

Still, I Walked With A Zombie is definitely worth a watch, and based on the extravagant praise that many viewers utter towards the film, you might like it much better than I do.",7
138,"I Walked with a Zombie (1943)

This sounds like a creaker, and it's not. The biggest reason? My guess is the director Jacques Tourneur, who had just finished the terrific ""The Cat People"" and was going to soon do the near legendary ""Out of the Past."" For this odd and enchanting zombie movie, he takes very little and makes a lot out of it. The mood, the plot (with help from writer Curt Siodmak, brother of the famous director Robert Siodmak), and the settings are made more substantial than was likely given the budget.

Besides the Jane Eyre-ish plot, the huge role given black actors is a rare thrill (for 1943) and they have complex and reasonably convincing roles to fill out, including the voodoo religious culture. There is one great dancing and drum scene halfway through that struck me as honest and great to watch.

There is no one of any fame here, yet all the key actors (there are half a dozen with critical roles) are really strong, not hammy and not faltering. I guess I keep addressing the fear that this is a low-budget cult film, and it doesn't feel like one. It's easily as good as most of the monster and horror films Universal was cranking out a decade after ""Dracula.""",7
139,"First of all: PLEASE don't let the misleading, rather silly sounding title discourage you! I walked with a Zombie is another brilliant result of the collaborations between producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur. Released one year after the simply astonishing movie 'Cat People', this is yet another intelligently elaborated and genuinely original genre-masterpiece. The solid screenplay contains a rarely seen before amount of eeriness and handles about a young ambitious nurse who goes to San Antonio in order to take care of Jessica. Jessica is the wife of plantation-owner Paul Holland and she suffers from a bizarre mental paralysis, supposedly caused by a tropical fever. She is  in fact  a zombie only not the type of walking corpse you usually expect in horror movies. Betsy, the nurse, is somehow convinced that Jessica may still be cured and turns to the Voodoo-community that is living on the island as well. Just like he pulled it off in Cat People, Tourneur manages to bring suspense in a subtle way. Without bloody images but with a unique photography and efficient set pieces! I walked with a Zombie contains great dialogs, intriguing characters and mind bending plot-twists. This is an intelligent and demanding film, especially made for people who take this genre serious! It ranks slightly under 'Cat People' but light-years above most other horror films. Check it out!",8
140,"Present day viewers watching this wonderful movie after reading the label ""horror"" and seeing the word ""zombie"" in the title, might be in for a shock if they think they're going to be in for a Romero/Fulci gorefest. This is a completely different kind of zombie movie! In fact, calling it horror is quite misleading, mystery is the more appropriate description. Anyone who has seen 'Cat People', the earlier collaboration between director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton, will know what to expect. A haunting and subtle yet suspenseful, and yes, at times quite scary, thriller. 'I Walked With A Zombie' (a classic title! Later lifted by Roky Erikson for a classic song) follows 'Cat People's ambiguous format quite closely with a series of events which may or may not have a supernatural explanation. Add a dash of 'Jane Eyre' to it and a West Indies setting and there you have it. Tourneur was a master of atmosphere and there are moments in this movie which are truly unforgettable. The two leads Tom Conway and Frances Dee are both very good, and Dee is cute to boot. I don't think 'I Walked With A Zombie' is quite as brilliant as 'Cat People', which I still think ties with the film noir classic 'Out Of The Past' as Tourneur's greatest film, but it comes very close, and I highly recommend it. If you've never seen this one before, turn off all the lights and watch with someone special. You are in for a real treat!",
141,"The basic plot: A Canadian nurse arrives at the isle of St. Sebastian to take care of a plantation owners mentally entranced and disturbed wife, but once she get's there, she learns more than she should about the family secrets, voodoo , and zombie fever......

The praise: A truly poetic, hypnotizing, and creepy film experience. The poetry of the island traditions, the family mysteries and everything else about the movie is truly evocative and sensitive. There are smatterings of spooky moments throughout, all frightening suggestively, using sound , imagery and implied chills. All classically and romantically constructed and written, a flagon of longing, taste, and character in every little detail. Well-shot, especially the impressive voodoo ceremony. Very atmospheric, with black& white used to enhance the mood, as in all Lewton movies. Watch for calypso singer Sir Lancelot, who Lewton also used in "" Curse of the Cat People"", an equally poetic movie, which I also have reviewed. A masterpiece of the horror film, it has many scenes which take together the essential elements of suspense and atmosphere , sound and imagery , such as Dee traveling to the voodoo ceremony. A must-see. Very hard-to-find. The only way I could find it was to order a copy of an unauthorized copy of it from Canada.Truly great.",
142,"A nurse (Frances Dee) is assigned to the West Indies to care for the semi-comatose wife of a plantation owner (Tom Conway). Over there she becomes involved with a very dysfunctional family and the realization that her patient may be a zombie--one of the living dead.

Eerie, poetic horror film--one of the great ones producer Val Lewton made for RKO on no budget. There are many creepy sequences--the crying and first meeting of Dee with her patient; the constant pounding of the voodoo drums in the distance at night; Dee being awakened by shadows outside her bedroom window; the walk through the sugar cane field to the voodoo ritual and the guard they must pass. There's also a man with a guitar who pops up from time to time acting as a Greek chorus--always commenting on the action. The script is very good and literate and the acting is actually not bad--except for Conway (who's lousy). But Ellison and Dee are good.

I almost gave this a 10--but one thing kept me from doing that. The silly love story between Conway and Dee. It's not needed and is a great distraction from the plot. Also Conway's acting is so bad that it makes the scenes play even worse. Those aside though, it's a truly great horror film. A must see.

Cute little trivia note: Look closely for the ""Any characters and events depicted in this photoplay..."" etc. etc. under the opening credits. Especially note this line: ""Any similarity to actual persons living, dead, OR POSSESSED is purely coincidental."" Cute joke...wonder how many people caught it.",9
143,"Betsy Connell's story starts simply enough with a job interview for a nursing position. She successfully lands the job, which will take her to St. Sebastian, an island in the Caribbean. She is charged with the care of Jessica, the wife of wealthy plantation owner Paul Holland. Betsy meets her new employer and they travel by ship to their destination. Paul is cold and curt, but the man nonetheless intrigues Betsy. After arriving at the well-appointed home she meets Paul's brother Wesley, and it is quickly established that there is animosity between the two brothers. She settles down for the evening but is awaken in the middle of the night by the crying of a woman. She investigates the source of the sound and follows it to another building on the property and is frightened by the gaunt and silent Jessica. Not the ideal first meeting with her new patient! Jessica is in a permanent non-responsive trance that resembles something close to sleepwalking. With only good intentions, Betsy sets out to care for Jessica any way she can, but becomes entangled in the local customs as well as the family's sordid past.

Jacques Tourneur directed a formidable trio of films for Val Lewton including Cat People and The Leopard Man. Due to the snug budgets; directors were expected to complete these projects in an efficient manner. If you're not able to do the job in the allotted time another director replaces you. Seems a bit harsh, but nobody said the film industry was all fun and games. Considering the time and money constraints it amazes me how polished these films are. There is not a minute of wasted celluloid. Although I Walked With A Zombie is only 69 minutes long, it doesn't feel like corners were cut. The character development is excellent and the simple, but engrossing story is very effective. I Walked With A Zombie is full to the brim with memorable scenes I couldn't possibly do justice, so I won't. But there is one particularly clever scene I loved, where we are given information about the Holland/Rand family history when a calypso singer plays a little number entitled Shame and Scandal In The Family, and it's pretty catchy too! The cherry on top is the superb surprise ending. It is also beautifully filmed. Black and white photography adds a great deal to mood and atmosphere but it is all the little flourishes that Tourneur adds that make this film special. The sound of ceremonial drums in the distance, wind rustling through fields, a dark shadow of a man passing over the wall as Betsy lies in bed and a late night voodoo ceremony. Imagery that is stunning, subtle and haunting. The sets, props, light and shadow are all used to great effect. Not to mention, I adore the fashion of the 40′s. The clothing was so elegant and chic, even their nightgowns are high fashion. I was completely hypnotized by I Walked With A Zombie from beginning to end.

The characters are interesting and the performances are top-notch. Particularly notable is the lovely Frances Dee who plays Betsy Connell and Tom Conway who plays Paul Holland. During their journey to the island Paul says to Besty ""It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand. Those flying fish, they're not leaping for joy, they're jumping in terror. Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water, it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. The glitter of putrescence. There is no beauty here, only death and decay. Everything good dies here, even the stars."" Okay, he might be stating fact, but freaking hell buddy, Cheer up! What a charmer! Regardless, the chemistry between these two works well. Even the films two ""zombies"" who remain in a silent trance throughout are perfect with their long lanky frames and gaunt faces.

This film was made in the 40′s so obviously a gorefest is unlikely. These zombies lack malice and have no hunger for human flesh. The horror elements are not shocking or grotesque, but work extremely well and add much to the films mystery and perfect mood. There is so much to admire here, in fact there really isn't anything I would change. I thoroughly enjoyed I Walked With A Zombie. Highly recommended!",10
144,"Nurse Betsy arrives in the West Indies to care for Jessica, the wife of Paul Holland. Jessica was struck down with a fever that has rendered her in a permanent state of mental paralysis. As Betsy starts to fall for Holland, she resolves to cure Jessica and get to the bottom of just what is going on in this mysterious place.

Producer Val Lewton firmly carved out a reputation for having a keen eye with a number of literary horror adaptations in the 1940s, there is certainly a case for I Walked With A Zombie being one of the best of the bunch. Tho tagged as a horror film, and boasting a title to further that inkling, I Walked With A Zombie is more in keeping with the dreamy and atmospheric romanticism of Jane Eyre. Sure the voodoo core of the film is chilling in its intent, but to really sell this as an outright horror film would do it a big disservice.

Lewton's ideals are more focused on suggestion in a psychological way, the scares more cloaked in a shadowy unease, director Jacques Tourneur perfectly in tune with his producer to unhinge the audience by way of an approaching dread we can't see. Some of Tourneur's work here is wonderful, hauntingly elegiac sequences linger long in the memory, rustling wind blows as characters are appearing to float thru sugar cane fields, the distant rumble of ceremonial drums luring them forward with mystical powers. A voodoo zombie shuffling on a mission to fetch poor Jessica from the plantation home is not horrifying, its damn near gorgeous, soft and near silent in its execution, the whole film is simply full of memorable moments.

Written by Curt Siodmak, the concept for the piece came about by way of a number of newspaper articles that were telling of voodoo and witchcraft in Haiti, the scope for a screamathon horror movie was obviously there, but thankfully in this viewers humble opinion, we get a classy and chilling film that is dripping with ethereal beauty from first reel to last. 8/10",8
145,"""I Walked With A Zombie"" is a brilliant bit of film making. Based somewhat on the classic story of ""Jane Eyre,"" ""Zombie"" takes us to the South Seas, where Nurse Betsy Connell arrives on a remote sugar plantation owned by the mysterious and reclusive Paul Holland. Betsy has been hired to care for Paul's wife Jessica, a catatonic beauty who wanders around in her nightgown a lot, looking (as the Sex Pistols once put it) Pretty Vacant. The locals whisper about zombies, believing that Jessica has been cursed and is now one of the living, walking dead. A calypso singer follows Nurse Betsy around a lot, providing her with clues in his catchy songs. Nurse Betsy, far from being a close-minded Westerner, becomes intrigued by the tales of zombies and is determined to learn the truth about Jessica's condition in hopes of curing the woman. She even bravely ventures into the cane fields in the dead of night, following the worlds creepiest looking native (a golf-ball eyed zombie-like man) to a voodoo ceremony with Jessica at her side.

Fans of Fulci zombies may be disappointed by the lack of gut-munching gore here. These zombies are not cadavers returned from the grave, half-rotted horrors shambling about looking for flesh to feast upon. These are traditional, mind-erased zombies, unfeeling, unthinking and unresponsive to anything. The atmosphere is wonderful, filled with great music, strong women and natives who look like the real thing. The love triangle quickly becomes a love square and the haunting conclusion is both shocking and grimly satisfying. Fans of the brilliant Tourneur won't be disappointed - his mark is all over this beautiful film, from beginning to end. It is one of his very best.",10
146,"""Jane Eyre"" transferred to the West Indies with Voodoo, Witchcraft and the occasional Zombie thrown in. Jacques Tourneur's ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is considered one of the most poetic of all horror films and it's certainly that; it's a film full or beauty, (gorgeously shot in black and white by J. Roy Hunt), with its frights mostly understated. Like ""Jane Eyre"" it's more of a dark love story and it's beautifully done. Frances Dee is outstanding as the young nurse who comes to a West Indian island to care for the wife of Tom Conway in the Rochester role. The best sequences finds Dee taking her charge through a plantation at night to a voodoo ceremony followed by an even more frightening scene when the giant native Carrefour, (Darby Jones), comes to steal the wife. If this a B-Movie it is one of the best ever made.",8
147,"***SPOILERS*** Undoubtedly the most atmospheric of the Lawton/Tourneur film collaborations ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is completely told in flashback by nurse Betsy Connell, Frances Dee. Who was sent from the cold weather of Ottawa Canada's Memorial Hospital to the warm Caribbean tropical breezes of the Island of St. Sebastian in the West Indies to care for Paul Holland's, Tom Conway, comatose wife Jessica.

A rehash of the Charlotte Bronte classic ""Jean Eyre"" the movie is also about the supernatural and unknown in the form of the Island's natives strange belief in Voodoo. Were also shown in the movie how it can effect a person thats put under it's spell by making them become a walking dead, a Zombie.

Betsy with the help of Dr. Maxwell, James Bell, can find no reason for Jessica's abnormal condition and thinks that she's the victim of some unknown tropical disease with no cure for it. But as the story goes on Betsy Paul and Dr. Maxwell as well as Paul's step-brother Wesley, James Ellison, begin to realize that what struck Jessica is something beyond the understanding of modern science or medicine. We learn the truth about Jessica, and what struck her and who was responsible for it, from non other then Mrs. Rand, Edith Barrett, Paul and Wesley's mother. Who's also a doctor, mostly for the natives, on the Island of St. Sebastian.

The movie has what's become a trademark in Lawton/Tourneur movies with it's use by director Tourneur of light and sound as well as the audience imagination to build up the tension. The tension reaches a point where it almost becomes unbearable to those watching without having a stiff drink to settle them down. The scene with Betsy and Jessica walking through the dark sugar cane field is a good example of how Tourneur can scare the hell out of you without any special effects like the way it's done in horror movies by todays movie makers.

In the quite and eerie moonlight the two women walk through the dark and spooky cane fields running into a host of bloodcurdling Voodoo artifacts. Then when reaching the outskirts of Islands Homefort where Betsy want to get Jessica help from the local Voodoo priestess, guess who she is, and runs into seven-foot tall Carre-Four, Darby Jones, standing guard. The sight of the creepy and giant Carre-Four scares the living hell out of Betsy as well as those of us in the audience watching. But that's as far as he's made to go by the movies director just to stand there, but the effect is absolutely heart-stopping.

Betsy falls in love with Paul but at the same time wants to restore Paul's wife Jessica back to health and thus lose him. Paul who also fell in love with Betsy want's her to leave the Island to prevent that from happening. But at the end of the movie it becomes evident that Jessica is not alive but a Zombie and it was Mrs. Rand who hid this from everyone to keep the truth from coming out. Mrs. Rand in a way held herself responsible for Jessica's illness since she was deeply involved with the Island natives who's spell put Jessica in that condition.

Were also told that Jessica was not exactly the sweet and kind person that Nurse Betsy was told that she was by Paul. I was Jessica that wanted to destroy the Holland family, as well as their sugar company on the Island, by having an affair with Paul's step-brother Wesley. This all lead to the casting of a deadly Voodoo spell on her by the local natives which turned her into a card carrying member of the walking dead.

Tragically in the end Wesley, who realized that his affair with Jessica lead to all this, together with the doomed and already dead Jessica end up under the waves of the Caribbean Sea. The movie does such a good job of exploring and explaining Voodoo and Zombies that it almost makes you believe, like it does Paul Wesley Betsy Dr. Maxwell and Mrs. Rand, in it.

Don't expect ""I Waked with a Zombie"" to be a horror movie. It's a far more gripping and perceptive film about the unknown that's all around us that were just too blind to see and believe. Until it's jolting effects hits us, like it did to those in the movie, right between the eyes.",8
148,"Frances Dee (Betsy) is appointed as a nurse to care for Christine Gordon (Jessica) on a Caribbean island. Gordon has a mysterious condition. Can it be attributed to voodoo or more natural causes? Whatever the condition, it is weird! The rest of the cast include her plantation-owner husband Tom Conway (Paul), his half-brother James Ellison (Wesley), their mother Edith Barrett, and a community of voodoo worshippers. They all have their own theories as to what has happened to Jessica. So, can nurse Frances get to the truth?

This film is way better than its title suggests. It's atmospheric, spooky, nicely shot and very unexpected as well as original in its setting. There are quite a few memorable set pieces in this fairly short film. In fact, it's all pretty memorable and keeps you watching. If you try to anticipate what is coming next, I guarantee you will get it wrong. I got things wrong every time I thought I knew what was going to happen. It's a very good film in that respect. So, just watch the story unfurl.

The actors are fine – I wasn't too enamoured with James Ellison given that he had the top credit. I don't think he deserved it. I'd have put him around 4th on the cast list. There are also several story threads left open and not fully explained but it doesn't matter, it adds to the mystery. I recommend this one - a different kind of zombie in this film. It's scary and sad.",8
149,"– This is an old gem, made by Val Lewton approximately 1945. The brainchild of producer Val Lewton as part of his cycle of psychological horror films made for RKO, it is loosely (or should I say unofficially), based upon ""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bronte. It is set on a Caribbean island as opposed to the windy Yorkshire moors.

Among the notables are Tom Conway (who in real life was George Sanders' brother) and Frances Dee. A young nurse, (Ms Dee) applies for a job to care for a woman on an island in the Caribbean who appears to be persistent vegetative. That is, she is an invalid and incapable of looking after herself. Dee falls in love with her patient's husband but is unaware of what caused his wife's condition. The husband (Tom Conway) has a half-brother (James Ellison) but they don't get along, the half-brother blaming him for the state his wife has been reduced to. The plot and thematic undercurrents of this film owe a lot to the source material, and the film finally becomes a meditation on the guilt of those who have neglected this woman and thus reduced her to a state of 'zombieism'.

The black and white cinematography is eerie, with a lot of scenes taking place at night. The scene of Dee confronting a giant zombie guardian in order to connect her charge to a zombie ritual that may provide a cure of the last resort, and thus bring Conway's wife back to the life she has previously known, is, I think, one of the scariest scenes in all of classic horror cinema. This is spooky stuff, but as in most of Lewton's films it is the things you aren't seeing that creates the horror. Some of the plot exposition is a bit overly talky, especially from Edith Barrett, who plays the mother of the two brothers who own the plantation. Audiences these days are used to so much editing and action, that it's easy for us to become bored when there is a lot of plot juxtaposition through dialogue. My favourite of Lewton's films is 'The Seventh Victim' but 'I Waked with a Zombie' runs second. It's one of those films that constantly surprises you even after you have watched it a number of times. It unfolds as if being a strange experience is the only thing it knows how to be. Lewton's films are dark and adult fairy tales which do not easily give up their mysteries. It is up to the viewer to demand their surrender by constant viewing and paying attention to every frame in order that some kind of meaning can be deciphered from the experience. Personally I find the effort entirely worthwhile and recommend 'I Walked With A Zombie' to anyone who loves classic movies, horror movies, or just plain good movies",9
150,"The beginning of the 40s brought many difficult times for RKO Studios, as after the commercial failure of Orson Welles' films (worsened by Hearst newspaper chain's attacks over ""Citizen Kane"") and other artistically ambitious movies, the studio was facing bankruptcy and extinction. However, the studio would find a relief for its problems in its B pictures division, specially in the unit commanded by producer Val Lewton, who soon after his appointment as head of RKO's horror unit, released what would be RKO's greatest hit of 1942: ""Cat People"". Directed by French filmmaker Jacques Tourneur, ""Cat People"" revolutionized the horror genre with its subtle atmospheric style and the inclusion of psychological horror. After the enormous success of ""Cat People"", Lewton and Tourneur began working on their next horror movie: the noir-influence ""I Walked with a Zombie"".

In ""I Walked with a Zombie"", Frances Dee plays Betsy Connell, a recently graduated Canadian nurse who travels from Ottawa to the Caribbean after being hired to take care of a mental patient in the island of St. Sebastian. In her trip, she meets Paul Holland (Tom Conway), owner of the sugar cane plantation where she is going to live, and soon she discovers that her patient is his wife, Jessica (Christine Gordon), who has been in a catatonic state after contracting a fever at St. Sebastian. Intrigued by her patient's condition, Betsy attempts to find out a cure for Jessica working with Dr. Maxwell (James Bell), but her lack of success makes her begin to wonder if the rumors about voodoo and zombies that circulate among the island's population are true after all. As she goes deeper into the intrigues at the plantation, she'll discover the horrible true behind Jessica's condition.

Loosely based on Charlotte Brontë's classic novel, ""Jane Eyre"", the film's story was conceived by Val Lewton and Inez Wallace and further developed by Ardel Wray and the legendary Curt Siodmak (of ""The Wolf Man"" fame). It is Siodmak's style the one that is felt the most though the movie, as like most of his best horror stories, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" has that mixture of horror and melodrama deeply rooted in the complex relationships between his characters and the way they interact with each other. Playing with elements of tragedy and melodrama, Siodmak builds up an intelligent Gothic horror story where sadness and decay are the dominant themes, and that keeps the subtle ambiguous style of ""Cat People"". Like his screenplay for ""The Wolf Man"", ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is filled with extremely good dialogs that certainly give the film a personality of its own.

However, where ""I Walked with a Zombie"" truly excels is in the directing department, where Jacques Tourneur once again shows his enormous talent behind the camera and proves that B-movies can be highly artistic too. With an excellent work of cinematography by the experienced J. Roy Hunt, Tourneur expands on the style he developed in ""Cat People"" and creates in the perfect hybrid of Film-Noir and horror movie in ""I Walked with a Zombie"", where he gives a morbid ambiguity to Siodmak's script. Highly atmospheric and even surreal, the film showcases a wonderful use of light and shadows that increases the feeling of dread and decay that surrounds the story. Tourneur's use of music and sound is another of the elements that make this movie remarkable, as Roy Webb's score is impressively haunting and adds a lot of power to the film.

The work done by the cast in ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is very effective, with most of the actors delivering excellent performances in their respective roles. Frances Dee is remarkable as nurse Betsy Connell, believably conveying the necessary innocence and naiveté of her character without making it clichéd. As Paul Hollan, Tom Conway delivers a restrained and subtle performance, which suits his troubled character perfectly and adds a lot to the plantation's mystery. However, the highlights of the film are definitely James Ellison and Edith Barrett, the first one giving a very convincing role as Paul's alcoholic half-brother and Mrs. Barrett delivering the film's best performance as the mother of the two, managing to shine despite her limited role. Finally, Christine Gordon is simply gorgeous as Jessica Holland, the alluring beauty who may be possessed by unseen forces.

Being a subtle and almost melancholic film, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is definitely less bombastic than its title (which Val Lewton hated) may suggest. And this misconception is probably the movie's biggest flaw, as while the movie is decidedly dark and morbid, it has nothing in common with the modern day concept of ""zombie film"" as reinvented by George Romero in 1968 (with ""Night of the Living Dead""). Tourneur's film has more to do with the original Caribbean voodoo folklore about zombies than with flesh-eating mobs of living corpses, so those expecting something similar to the works of Romero and Fulci will be sorely disappointed. In this aspect, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" has more to do with Victor Halperin's classic from the 30s, ""White Zombie"", as not only both share the same background, but also have almost the same Gothic visual style.

While definitely not as influential as ""Cat People"", personally I find ""I Walked with a Zombie"" to be the best movie among the ones done by Tourneur and Lewton, thanks to its beautiful visuals and the power of Siodmak's story. A powerful and haunting story of horror and suspense, this classic from the 40s is a definitive must-see, not only for fans of horror and film noir, but really for anyone willing to watch classic cinema at its best. 10/10",10
151,"The Canadian nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) is hired to travel to St. Sebastian, in West Indies, to work at Fort Holland nursing Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon), the wife of the sugar plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway). Betsy meets Paul in the ship and is welcomed by Paul's estranged half-brother Wesley ""Wes"" Rand (James Ellison) in the farmhouse. During the night, she overhears a woman crying and she believes that might be Jessica and goes to her room. She finds a creepy mute woman and she learns that Jessica had a mental paralysis after a severe tropical fever and is a hopeless case, unable to speak or have power. Soon Betsy falls in love with Paul and she decides to help Jessica to be cured to make Paul happier. She suggests an experimental treatment with shock to Dr. Maxwell (James Bell) but it fails. While talking to the maid Alma (Theresa Harris), she discovers that another woman was cured in a voodoo ceremony by a voodoo priest and she decides to use witchcraft to cure Jessica. However the natives believe that Jessica is a zombie that cannot be cured. When Betsy meets Paul and Wesley's mother Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett), she finds that Jessica was the pivot of a fight between Paul and Wes and she believes that her daughter-in-law is a zombie.

""I Walked with a Zombie"" is an ambiguous zombie movie directed by Jacques Tourneur. The plot is a family drama and the zombies in this movie are not like in George Romero's trilogy or ""The Walking Dead"", but related to voodoo in a Caribbean Island. There is a creepy atmosphere with a beautiful cinematography, the non-stop voodoo drums and the native Carrefour, but no gore, violent death or scream. The conclusion is ambiguous after the revelation of Mrs. Rand. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): ""A Morta-Viva"" (""The Living Dead"")",7
152,"There are a lot of terrific elements in this movie. It is moody and atmospheric, subtly ominous, and like many Lewton movies leaves its supernatural elements ambiguous.

But the most unusual thing aspect from a 1940s movie is how it treats black people. First off, note that the West Indies natives don't speak in either the ""yass ma'am"" or ""ooga booga"" styles that represented the entire spectrum of black portrayals in the U.S. at the time. They talk in slightly accented, but perfectly normal English.

Also, the movie specifically mentions the slave industry at least twice. There is a wonderful scene near the beginning in which the main character discusses the island's history with her driver. He mentions they were brought here in chains and she says, well at least they brought you to a beautiful place. ""If you say so,"" he says, very politely

That is such an awesome exchange. He is a servant and he's not going to argue with her, but he also won't kowtow. It is a conversation you can actually believe would happen.

The movie also shows surprising respect for the Voodoo aspects. The natives believe in it, but they aren't mocked for it, and in the ceremony they do actual African dance, instead of some weird Hollywood fakery.

The movie, again typical of Lewton, has a lovely complexity to it. Characters are more than they appear to be, and their motives are not simple.

It's not a perfect movie. Some of the acting is less than stellar and I suspect some explanatory scenes were cut, as it sometimes feels rushed and slightly disconnected. But it is not to be missed.",8
153,"Betsy Conwell (Frances Dee) takes a job on a West Indies island as the private nurse to the wife of plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway). Paul's wife Jessica lives in a waking comatose state, believed to be caused by some tropical disease. Betsy begins to fall for Paul and tries to help him by finding a cure for Jessica with the native witch doctors.

I Walked with a Zombie is the second of producer Val Lewton's classic psychological horror films. Although this is a mix of horror with the romance and mystery genres. The story is based off of the Charlotte Bronte novel ""Jane Eyre,"" where the governess falls in love with the master of a large house who harbors a secret about his ill wife.

I love this film. I love the ambiance, the sets, the unsettling mystery. There's an eerie atmosphere that permeates it. Jacques Tourneur, who also directed the amazing Cat People for Lewton, does a fantastic job here at creating this dream-like mood throughout the picture. Curt Siodmak and Ardel Wray provide an excellent script. As with other Lewton films, a sense of ambiguity lingers over the plot. Is Jessica really physically ill or has she been affected somehow by voodoo?

It's a great cast. In addition to Tom Conway and Frances Dee, there's Edith Barrett as Paul's mother who believes she knows what caused Jessica's condition. James Ellison plays his brother who is in love with Jessica. Lovely Christine Gordon plays Jessica, and though she has no lines, gives a memorable performance I believe. This film also has a fine black supporting cast, with some great work from Theresa Harris, Sir Lancelot as an ominous calypso singer, and Darby Jones as the alarmingly bug-eyed Carre-Four. As with most of the Lewton RKO films, it's a truly great movie that everybody should see.",8
154,"In the beautiful Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian, nurse Betsy (Frances Dee) is called in to help care for the near-comatose Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon). Jessica is awake, but is seemingly unaware of anything around her; a 'zombie', if you will. She is the wife of Paul Holland (Tom Conway), who is a sullen and brooding man, and who runs a sugar plantation along with his half-brother Wesley (James Ellison). One day in town whilst having drinks with Wesley, a calypso singer begins a song of how Wesley had an affair with Jessica, and how Paul drove her to madness when he found out. Curious about her condition, and of the voodoo antics that are being undertaken by the island's inhabitants, Betsy searches for a cure, and for the reason behind her zombie-state.

I've long been a fan of French director Jacques Tourneur, who at the age of ten moved to America with his father, also a film director. Tourneur is an uncelebrated master of his trade. Apart from this, I've only seen two other of his movies, but they were enough to convince me that Tourneur is extremely underrated when compared to the likes of James Whale and Terence Fisher. One of these films is Cat People, a masterpiece in the art of sound and lighting, and the other is Night Of The Demon, an enjoyable hybrid of horror and film noir. Tourneur was the master of a forgotten art - scaring the audience without actually showing anything. The popular scene in Cat People is a fine example of this, when our heroine is stranded in a swimming pool at night, and the sounds of a screeching panther coming from all angles. Nothing is seen, but everything is felt.

While I wouldn't say this film is scary by any means, the atmosphere is certainly rather sinister and creepy, and the cinematography by J. Roy Hunt is outstanding. The lighting and camera movements allow what should be a standard horror story to become almost poetic. The film itself is rather slight, clocking in at around an hour and 10 minutes, but it keeps the story snappy and fast-paced. But the story itself takes a backseat to the visuals, and there's nothing at all wrong with that. This is a Gothic horror full of style and atmosphere, with some good performances to boot. But the real star here is Tourneur himself.

155,"Director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton are noted for their more cerebral forays into the horror genre and this is one of the finest of their partnership. The basic story centers around voodoo in the islands and the real or imagined effects it has on one particular family. I never know whether Tom Conway is a good, low-key actor or not an actor at all but here he does a passable job as the tortured husband. Frances Dee is sweet as the nurse who gets entangled in the family problems and tries to help to no avail. Although Christine Gordon says not a word during the whole film, her image and unusual beauty is haunting. Edith Barrett, an actress who was pitifully under used in film, is outstanding as the mother who plays a rather surprising role. The whole film is based on atmosphere and great cinematography....it is chilling without showing much, therefore leaving a lot to the imagination. There is no violence,no special effects and no gore but it will hold you in suspense just the same. The choice of title is unfortunate (but so was ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"" which was also a good film). I rate this movie as one of the Tourneur/Lewton masterpieces and highly recommend it to all lovers of the genre.",
156,"I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is a classic of atmospheric horror that comes courtesy of famed producer Val Lewton. Like the rest of Lewton's output in the 1940s, this is a mood piece all about the atmosphere; the story comes second to the visuals and the stylistics. The story is set in the Caribbean and features a plucky young nurse heroine who arrives at a plantation only to discover some weird goings-on involving her employer's somnambulist wife.

Essentially it's Jane Eyre with zombies, and there's no harm in that. The voodoo material in this production is pretty effective, and the horror highlight is the sight of Darby Jones as the emaciated zombie with bulging eyeballs wandering through the cane fields; these scenes are quite exceptional and help to make the film. However, the dialogue scenes are also engaging and there's never a dull moment despite the slow pace. I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is a classic for good reason.",7
157,"""I Walked with a Zombie"" is one of the most highly regarded of the handful of horror films that Val Lewton produced in the early to mid forties. The story is based partly on Charlotte Brontë's ""Jane Eyre"" and partly on a magazine article by Inez Wallace.

In the film, a young Canadian nurse accepts a position in the West Indies where she will care for a plantation manager's convalescent wife. She finds that the woman's mental faculties have been affected by a fever and the locals refer to her as a zombie. She determines to effect a cure, even if she has to enter into the mysterious (and potentially dangerous) world of voodoo.

The acting is decent enough but nothing to write home about. The top-billed James Ellison gives a forgettable performance but co-stars Frances Dee & Tom Conway fare better. In support, some actors seem more authentic than others but overall the cast is satisfactory.

Jacques Tourneur was handed the directorial duties and he did a fine job with the resources that were available to him. The direction, cinematography & score (by Roy Webb) create an ominous atmosphere that makes up for any inadequacies inherent in the film's low budget. The screenplay (co-written by Curt Siodmak) also deserves praise for its psychological depth and ambiguous treatment of the supernatural.

All in all, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is a worthwhile horror picture and a welcome change from today's stereotypical flesh-eating zombies. While its B-movie origins are sometimes apparent, this film elevates itself above the usual expectations with intelligent screen writing and skillful technique.",7
158,"When I watched this movie, I expected (based on the goofy title) a ""B"" movie, what I saw was a wonderfully written and acted movie. Val Lewton's vision of ""Jane Eyre"", set in San Sebastian satisfied me in every way.

Frances Dee plays Betsy Connell, an idealistic nurse who goes to San Sebastian, in the Carribbean, to take care of the catatonic wife of Paul Holland (played by Tom Conway). She arrives not knowing that Jessica is to quote her ""a mental case"". Is Jessica the victim of a strange virus that robbed her of her mental facilities or a victim of voodoo? The dynamics of the island and the 2 brothers who both loved the doomed Jessica are explored amongst the background of revenge and voodoo. The scene where Betsy takes Jessica to the voodoo ""home fort"" is one of the eeriest, scariest scenes I have ever scene.

Lewton creates an atmosphere of dread and fear without displaying any overt violence or gore. That is the work of a true master.

I love all of Lewton's movies but this stands above the rest as a true masterpiece of it's genre. Enjoy!!!!",10
159,"The most arresting scene from ""I Walked With a Zombie"" was featured in Martin Scorsese's ""A Personal Journey Through American Movies"". Anyone who saw that clip would want to know more about it. Unfortunately, the film does not quite live up to the promise of that eerie sequence when Francis Dee leads Christine Gordon in a twilight journey through the cane fields. Although the film is not equal to the sum of its parts, those parts are still interesting.

Apparently producer Val Lewton was saddled with the title but allowed to construct his own story around it. He chose to re-work Bronte's Jane Eyre, setting it on a Caribbean island with a theme of voodoo and black magic.

Betsy Connell, a nurse played by Francis Dee, is hired to tend the wife of a sugar planter on a Caribbean Island. She journeys to the island by schooner with the planter, Paul Holland – played with monumental stiffness by Tom Conway – and realises he is a man with issues. On her first night, she dines with Paul's half-brother Wesley Rand, played by James Ellison, and discovers that the case has some unexpected twists.

Betsy meets her patient, Jessica Holland, played by Christine Gordon, when she finds her in a trance-like state climbing the stairs of the tower. Yes, there is a tower, and those stairs could only exist in a movie such as this; they are so perilous one would almost need the help of a Sherpa to climb them.

During a visit to the nearby town, Betsy strikes up a friendship with Mrs Rand, Paul and Wesley's mother played by Edith Barrett. Betsy learns that Jessica Holland's illness has been brought about by an adulterous affair with her brother-in-law, Wesley. Betsy is persuaded to seek help for Jessica from the island's voodoo practitioners.

On the given evening, Betsy leads Mrs. Holland on that aforementioned journey to the voodoo ceremony. The finale of the movie reveals that Jessica has been one of the undead all along – a zombie in fact – all as a result of the powerful emotions her affair with Wesley had unleashed in his mother. By this time, Betsy has fallen in love with Paul Holland and they seek each other's support when Wesley finally ends Jessica's torment and his own.

Sound complicated? It is. For a seventy-minute movie there is enough plot, exposition and revelation for a mini-series. Although made on a tight budget, the film has great mood thanks to its celebrated art direction – the Caribbean setting allowed for extensive use of shutters and slats that bathe the characters with an amazing interplay of light and shade.

The movie is set in an indeterminate time – the fashions, and other references mark it as modern day (the 1940's) but there is not one automobile to be seen in the entire movie.

The film makes few demands on the actor's abilities. The two male leads are not much above the zombie level themselves. Sandra Dee is fine as Betsy Connell but any number of actresses could have been cast without any loss of effect.

It is perhaps wrong to label ""I Walked with a Zombie"" as a horror story. Like many of Lewton's films it is more of a psychological study; it even delivers a reasonably plausible explanation for Jessica's affliction. ""I Walked With a Zombie"" is an unusual film but it does contain a couple of sequences that are compelling enough to be fondly remembered by one of cinema's modern masters.",7
160,"Just watched on YouTube this, the second collaboration of director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton after Cat People. Betsy Connell (the stunning Frances Dee) is a just registered nurse arriving at a tropical island to care for a comatose Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon), wife of plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway who previously was in Cat People). Also around are his half-brother, Wesley Rand (James Ellison), and their mother, Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett who was only a few years older or younger than much of the cast I've mentioned so far). Betsy is an assistant to a Dr. Maxwell (James Bell). Despite Paul's less-than-warm demeanor, Betsy falls for him to the point of willing to help bring his wife back to life when she takes her to a voodoo ceremony-of which maid Alma (Theresa Harris, also from Cat People) also attends. They manage to pass a guard named Carrefour (Darby Jones) when he sees their medals on their clothes. Oh, and a calypso singer (Sir Lancelot who would later appear in Lewton's The Curse of the Cat People) sings about the half-brothers' problems which gets unknowingly performed in front of Betsy and Wesley at a café as Wesley gets very upset...This, like other Lewton horror films, was not scary in a scream-your-lungs-out kind of way. It was just meant to make you soak in the atmosphere like when Betsy and Jessica walk to and from the ceremony while drums are heard playing. So don't go expecting lots of thrills and chills though there is some of the latter at the end. Fine performances all, so on that note, I highly recommend I Walked with a Zombie. P.S. While Ms. Harris and others of her race are indeed stuck playing servant roles during this period of movies, it was refreshing to hear her speak perfect English, with the exception of a double negative, in this picture.",8
161,"The version of Zombie I have is off UK TV from the '80's, watched umpteen times since. The print could have done with sprucing up back then, so if it's still possible I hope a future DVD release will be a remaster too.

Writing as one possessed - by admiration for this film, I would say it's my favourite Lewton, after Night of the Demon my favourite Tourneur, and it was Conway's finest hour (and six minutes) too. Coming so soon after Kane, Ambersons and Cat People, RKO must have been wondering if they would ever get back to making pure b pictures again! It's a richly atmospheric b&w nitrate photographed minor classic, presenting ""real"" zombies and zombieism in a non-sensational and bloodless way. White Zombie from 11 years previous comes closest to this, but is a creaker - Romero's later vile-ent efforts all depicted ghouls, not zombies. I guess I only like old-fashioned ""horror"", not the horror that is modern ""horror"".

My daughter pointed out sadly that at the dinner table on the veranda it should really have been James Ellison hiding the whisky decanter from alcoholic Tom Conway, not vv. Worthy film especially to fans of how it used to be done.",8
162,"After watching I Walked With A Zombie I was shaken a bit, a little unnerved as it were. But when I started to analyze the film I was wondering just what did I see?

Frances Dee has been hired to look after Tom Conway's wife Christine Gordon who is in a coma, but this is the sleepwalking type of coma and the natives have identified here as a zombie. Here illness whatever it is has cast a pall on the household. Conway and his mother apparently make a nice income which is half brother James Ellison drinks a lot of it away.

One thing that was interesting and highly unusual. The natives are the descendants of escaped slaves and the heritage there is one of reverting back to their tribal beliefs as an act of defiance. Slavery with few exceptions is rarely dealt with from the slave or former slave point of view.

Edith Barrett plays Conway and Ellison's mother. She likes Dee and views here as an ideal daughter-in-law for one of her kids. She also has another role on the island, one I can't reveal here.

Val Lewton produced and Jacques Tourneur directed I Walked With A Zombie. It's not great, I think it was butchered in the editing department. But the mood that is created will linger with you. And the ending is decades ahead of its time, something you might see in a Stephen King work.",6
163,"Betsy is a nurse hired by Paul Holland, a sugar plantation owner on the Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian, to care for his comatose wife. Upon arrival, Betsy finds her patient's condition shrouded in mystery, a bitter family feud and the powerful influence of the local voodoo traditions. To complicate matters, she gradually falls in love with Paul ...

This is an extremely original, fabulous little film, which, despite its lurid title and meagre budget, has become a respected cult classic which continues to intrigue audiences on TV decades after the glossy romances and musicals it played as a B-feature to have been forgotten. Its power comes from the genius of two Hollywood immigrants; French director Tourneur, who creates an incredible style and atmosphere from almost nothing, and German writer Curt Siodmak, who seamlessly incorporates Gothic romantic elements from Jane Eyre and Rebecca into a a creepy, haunting tale of voodoo and hedonism. The sequence where Dee and Gordon walk through the canefields in search of the Houmfort is one of the subtlest, most spookily effective in all horror cinema, and the tragic plight of the characters, ending in a murder-suicide and a grim epitaph is still as potent and shocking as ever. This short film is crammed with memorable scenes - the minstrel's sung warning to Dee (""Her eyes are empty and she cannot talk / And a nurse has come to make her walk / The brothers are lonely and the nurse is young / And now you must see that my song is sung ... ""), Ellison suddenly emerging from the shadows behind Conway, Barrett's guilty confession of the voodoo curse, all of the shots involving the amazing-looking Jones. Beautifully photographed by J. Roy Hunt, and handsomely produced by Val Lewton. Tourneur is probably the classic example of the refined Old School of horror film-making (though he worked in lots of genres) where what the movie creates in your own imagination is much more terrifying than anything you see. He was a brilliant director, and this is arguably his best movie. Sensational.",7
164,"Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur's follow-up to CAT PEOPLE (1942) may not be as readily enjoyable - leaving some rabid genre fans underwhelmed as well - but, if anything, it's even more complex and mature (Tourneur himself considered it the best film he ever made): while Kent Smith was essentially bland, here we have two rather dark male leads in Tom Conway and James Ellison (both of whom turn in fine performances far beyond their usual standards); in fact, characterization is very well thought out all the way (considering it's a B horror piece barely over an hour in length!).

Frances Dee makes for a very sympathetic heroine, while Edith Barrett gives another multi-layered portrayal as Conway and Ellison's mother (the two men are half-brothers) who herself bears a guilty conscience; Sir Lancelot is a native troubadour who sings a haunting tune - actually reprised in the 1945 spoof ZOMBIES ON Broadway, co-starring Bela Lugosi! - about the zombie 'plague' and its connection to Conway, Ellison and Christine Gordon (as Conway's 'afflicted' wife). The creepy-looking Darby Jones also makes an undeniable impression as the zombie guardian Carrefour (and even returned for the aforementioned ZOMBIES ON Broadway).

J. Roy Hunt's noir-ish cinematography is masterly throughout (particularly its penchant to shoot through venetian blinds), allowing for several effective sequences: Frances Dee being stalked first by Christine Gordon and then by Darby Jones (who mistakes her for Gordon, because she's wearing her nightgown - as picked up in the perceptive Audio Commentary by the ultra-enthusiastic Kim Newman and Stephen Jones, this actually symbolizes Dee's having taken Gordon's place in Tom Conway's affections!); the celebrated title sequence leading up to the zombie rituals; and the tragically poetic finale.

It's regrettable that, following George A. Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), all zombie films presented the creatures as flesh eaters since the early examples of the genre, motivated by voodoo - as here but also (to name just the landmark titles) WHITE ZOMBIE (1932), THE PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES (1966), and even the superb Bob Hope spoof THE GHOST BREAKERS (1940) - gave the monsters an eerie, quasi-mystical quality that was eventually largely eradicated! The script of this film (co-written by Curt Siodmak) is actually an interesting transposition in straight horror terms of Charlotte Bronte's popular and oft-filmed Gothic romance ""Jane Eyre"". The Audio Commentary (given the great fun that this track proved to be, I look forward to listening to other Newman/Jones Commentaries such as - all R2 exclusives - THE OLD DARK HOUSE [1932; I actually brought it forward in my Halloween schedule because of this!], COUNTESS Dracula [1971], HANDS OF THE RIPPER [1971], THE MEDUSA TOUCH [1978] and THE DEAD ZONE [1983]) also mentions a number of deleted scenes which were shot but, presumably, haven't survived; still, in its current compact form, the film could hardly be improved upon!",8
165,"Well, this was nothing like I thought it might be, which means good news and bad news.

BAD NEWS - Very little action, almost none. Mostly talk, talk and more talk. This was much more of melodrama with the only skeletons were the ones in the closet that are revealed near the end, uncovering past sins in a family. With the title of this film, I can't expecting something dramatic, something to happen....but it didn't.

GOOD NEWS - The black-and-white film offered some great visuals, wonderful contrasts and, as Lewton films are known to do - ""atmospheric"" cinematography. That, and the strange-looking anorexic voodoo man, are my main good memories of this film, which was transfered nicely on DVD as part of the Lewton Horror Collection.

The acting was fine and the dialog interesting at times. In summary, a so-so film I might watch again, and I might not. It's that kind of film.",5
166,"Jacques Tourneur is an under appreciated legend of film-making. His films are consistently overlooked and underexposed, and it's a huge shame because Tourneur is one of the directors that helped shape the film industry as it is today. It can be said that Tourneur's best work is within the horror genre, and that is definitely the truth. His masterpiece is Cat People, but I Walked with a Zombie isn't far behind. Not far behind at all. The story of this one follows Betsy, a young nurse that is dispatched to the West Indies to care for the wife of plantation manager, Paul. Paul's wife is alive, but she has no life. Despite having vital signs, Paul's wife sits and stares; she's in a perpetual coma. So what exactly is wrong with Paul's wife?

The key to this film is the atmosphere; from the word go, Tourneur puts us on edge with a morbid tone that he creates from telling the audience that despite appearances, nothing in the West Indies is beautiful, and there is a sense of death everywhere in the vicinity. Tourneur then takes it further by indulging us in the zombie legend through way of voodoo ceremonies and various malicious imagery. With this, Tourneur manages to keep the audience's attention throughout, and even though the title gives away what Paul's wife's condition is; we still want to find out more. Fans of more recent zombie classics such as 'Dawn of the Dead' should note that this is film isn't your 'normal' zombie film, and actually plays out as more of a psychological drama than anything. Tourneur never shows us anything graphic, but unlike many other films; this one simply doesn't need it. The atmosphere that the film gives off is delicious, and the power of suggestion is more than enough for Tourneur to adequately portray all the horror that the film needs.

I Walked with a Zombie is an absolute classic and a must see for any fan of cinema. A good rule of thumb is that if it's Tourneur and horror; you can't go wrong. If it's Tourneur and other genres (such as jungle adventure), it can be a bit dicey; but this is Tourneur on very top form, and because of that; here we have a film that you will not want to miss.",9
167,"Thought-provoking, literate horror from RKO Radio Pictures. This 'Jane Eyre'-like story is probably the most memorable Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur collaboration. This eerie film still holds firm after all these years. The story's menacing fear is not what appears on screen, but what hovers in the minds of the characters on screen. A young American nurse(Frances Dee)comes to Haiti to care for a rich plantation owner's(Paul Holland)catatonic wife(Christine Gordon), who appears to be burnt out by a tropical disease. Of course the locals believe she is a zombie...victimized by rampant voodoo. The nurse falls in love with her employer and is desperate to find a cure for his wife and seeks a cure at a voodoo ritual. Creepy enough with great eerie atmosphere. Rounding out the cast are: James Ellison, Edith Barrett and the beach strolling zombie...Darby Jones.",6
168,"*Spoiler/plot- I walked with a zombie, 1943. A Canadian pretty nurse arrives in the West Indies island St. Sebastian to care for the wife of wealthy sugar plantation owner. The young nurse thinks she seems to be living in paradise, despite plantation owner's dim view of his surroundings. His half-brother is much cheerier. When the nurse finally meets the plantation owner's wife, she finds the wife walking in the garden late at night. The wife is in a trance state. The family doctor explains that the wife has a severe tropical fever that burned out portions of her spine, leaving her in a zombie-like state. It's recommended to try insulin shock treatment. The nurse also begins to wonder if local native voodoo might be able to cure the wife.

*Special Stars- James Ellison, Frances Dee, Tom Conway, Edith Barret, James Bell, Sir Lancelot. Dir- Jacques Tourneur.

*Theme- The occult is dangerous.

*Trivia/location/goofs- American, RKO studios. Val Lewton did not like the article ""I Walked With A Zombie"" by Inez Wallace that had been optioned so he adapted the story to fit the novel ""Jane Eyre"" because he felt the article's plot was too clichéd. The two figures seen walking along the beach during the opening credits are Frances Dee and Darby Jones.

*Emotion- A horror noir film from this period in film history. In this film; less is more. The audience gets a chance to be involved in the film's action and goes along for a fun intriguing ride.

*Based On- Jane Eyre book and West Indies island zombie myths.",
169,"I Walked with a Zombie starts in Canada where a nurse named Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) is offered a job in which she would have to travel to an island named St. Sebastian in the West Indies to care for Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon) the invalid wife of a plantation owner named Paul (Tom Conway), she accepts the position. Once there Betsy discovers that Jessica has no will or mind to call her own as she just walks & stares into space, nothing else. As the days pass Betsy begins to hear stories about how Jessica ended up in the state that she has, Dr. Maxwell (James Bell) claims a tropical disease that damaged her spinal cord while she also hears tales of Voodoo curses & the like. Betsy feels sorry for the Holland's, when medical science fails to provide a cure & not knowing what to believe anymore she turns to the ancient tribal Voodoo rituals of the natives to try & cure Jessica...

Directed by Jacques Tourneur & produced by the legendary Val Lewton for RKO pictures I Walked with a Zombie is one of the finest early horrors out there that I have seen, if not the finest. The script by Curt Siodmak & Ardel Wray is apparently based on the novel 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte Bronte & is wonderfully structured, there is always a fine between the real cause of what has happened to Jessica, whether it's sinister Voodoo or something more mundane like disease. Maybe Paul was responsible out of revenge because Jessica wanted to leave him for his half-brother Wesley (James Ellison) or maybe their mother (Edith Barrett) didn't want Jessica to break the family apart, the superbly written dialogue really helps to keep things murky & interesting. The story is strong although it's up to the viewer to decide in the end, I liked the openness of I Walked with a Zombie. The love affair between Paul & Betsy is a bit abrupt & unrealistic but I suppose it could happen. On the negative side not that much actually happens & if your looking for hordes of flesh eating zombies then forget it, it's not even made totally clear whether Jessica is a zombie.

Director Tourneur does a marvellous job here & creates some wonderful atmosphere throughout using light & shadow to fantastic effect, I absolutely loved the shots of Jessica & Betsy walking through the cane field at night as the wind blew & ruffled the crop & their long elegant dresses, I could almost feel the cold chill of that wind in my front room. The spooky tower with it's spiral staircase, the Voodoo rituals & more besides. I Walked with a Zombie is a very visual film that evokes emotion, I loved the look & feel of it. Forget about any violence, just a hanging animal but that's not what I Walked with a Zombie is about.

Technically the film is a good as any from 1943 can be, sure it may not impress too many people these days but I think a lot of time & effort was put into I Walked with a Zombie & is far superior to most horror films from this period that I have seen. The acting is OK although some of it is a bit wooden by the supporting cast members, Gordon as Jessica doesn't say a word during the film yet you still feel for her.

I Walked with a Zombie is surely a true classic of the genre & I wholeheartedly recommend it to all horror fans & anyone else who enjoys well written, well made films. Having said that if you want explosions, blood, bad language, computer effects every few minutes & can't sit through a black and white film then I Walked with a Zombie is not for you. A bit of a gem.",8
170,"Forget the awful script and acting, and concentrate on the poetry. This is arguably Lewton's best film, vying for that title with Cat People and The Body Snatcher. The plot may be absurd, and the attempt to reproduce Jane Eyre hamfisted (not helped by Tom Conway, who should never have been given a contract to do anything involving opening his mouth). But the sequence in which Frances Dee walks through the woods with her 'zombie' patient is one of the most compelling moments in cinema. Shot in virtual silence, we follow the ghostly pair through rushes and trees marked with strange icons and signs, with the unspoken threat getting nearer and nearer.

There are other great moments as well, such as the appearance of Carrefour's shadow as Dee is sleeping, or the final drowning sequence.

Throughout, Lewton and Tourneur create a dreamlike, poetic texture, the like of which is rarely seen (or even attempted) on film. The soundtrack is subdued, the photography glowing, the pace steady but not slow, the dynamics tense, and the effect both lyrical and chilling. A beautiful piece of cinema, which horror film makers of today should study - they could learn a lot about how to handle suspense and shock without making a noise.",9
171,"That's what I said. What in the world, or rather, other world was that all about? Beautifully atmospheric and photographed and as James Agee said about Frances Dee ""one of the most beautiful faces in Hollywood"", and well enough acted. But - what was going on? One absurdity after another. No real need to make any sense out of it. After all, what sense could be made? None. Too many loose ends and unfinished thoughts and jumpings ahead and poorly scripted without anything holding it up. And, finally, who cares and if you do, why? However - it was exquisite to look at which is all that you need to do for this film. Just look at it and breathe it in. And, in the end, in this film - that is all that really mattered. 6 stars for ""stuff"" and 11 stars for beauty.",6
172,"This is a very strange movie in several ways--beyond just that fact that the producer and director wanted a ""strange"" film. The genre of film is very tough to determine for I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE. Despite the title and the zombies, this really isn't a horror film--though there are definitely some scary elements. And, unlike the original, it isn't exactly a romance. Sure, the nurse (Francis Dee) does become infatuated with the older brother (Tom Conway--the real life brother of George Sanders), but unlike the original Jane Eyre, this is not really fully developed in the film. And, in some ways, it's a mystery film because HOW Conway's wife became a zombie was a secret that is only revealed at the end. And, it's a tragedy as the ending, in particular, is quite sad. So, in effect, it's a horror-like romantic-suspense-mystery! Considering that the movie was a B-movie with a small budget and lesser name actors, they certainly had a very successful film that delivered a lot of ""bang for the buck"". The acting was decent, the direction superb and the sets super-effective. While not a great film, it is quite entertaining and worth seeing. I was really torn on how to score this film--it's more of a 7.5!",7
173,"Hoping to get away from a stressful relationship, a nurse takes a job looking after a bedridden millionaire in Haiti, but when she starts to stay there longer, the more she finds the entire situation encased in a series of voodoo-driven rites and ceremonies intended to ward off her employer.

Overall this one was quite enjoyable if slightly flawed effort. One of the main things holding this one back is the film's utterly bland and snail-like pacing, which is the common factor found in these types of films. There's so many scenes here in the first half that do nothing overall and are really just there to make the film seem like an appropriate length before it ends since so little of the film actually comes off as scary. Since so many of these scenes are filled with her initial arrival and meeting with the two brothers who are engaged in their own mini-squabble over the afflicted wife's treatment, these scenes are in general quite dull and bland which simply hold off the main horror sections of the film to rather isolated section in the second half as it has to get through dry, dull sections up front. As well, the decision for including the plot-point of his brothers' drinking problems are completely unnecessary as they just make the film that much longer and are not that interesting having it play out, and really sets the stage for usually-talkative explanation sequence which doesn't really go anywhere here. The only other flaw here is the completely inane reasoning given for them being targeted, as it really makes no sense and goes against what she tells them later on which should've protected them instead and it seems somewhat odd as an explanation.Though these issues here hold this one back, it does have some positive elements at work here. One of the better features here is the fact that there's some rather creepy and chilling work done on the inclusion of the voodoo rituals at the compound which are some of the films' most chilling moments. Starting with the deeply-rousing tribal drumming that's heard coming from deep in the jungle sounding like they're all around them, and it really starts in on that driving feel where the otherworldly feel and chilling-by-association nature makes this quite creepy while starting the other big voodoo-led activities. From the insanely chilling walk-through of the sugarcane fields with the zombified woman in the moonlight while the effectively eerie drumming comes into play during the darting shots of them amongst the towering plants, the absolutely creepy first encounter with the zombie and then encountering the rather thrilling ceremony that takes place at their camp. Other fun scenes include the absolutely wild and crazy retrieval scenes where they attempt to bring her back to camp in her zombie-like state several times, especially since the later one turns into the outrageously fun finale that takes place across the island, finally leading into the sea for a fantastic finish to this one. Alongside the rather well-done atmosphere from the film, these here really work nicely for this one.

Today's Rating/PG: Mild Violence.",6
174,"""I Walked With A Zombie"" is about Nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee), who leaves her home to the West Indies for a care giving/nursing job, taking care of the catatonic, mute wife of Paul Holland (Tom Conway, of the early horror masterpiece ""The Seventh Victim"", and ""Cat People""), the owner of a sugar plantation. The locals believe that his wife, Jessica, was cursed by a zombie, and now is herself one of the living dead. Betsy becomes encompassed in the tales and local legend, including bizarre rituals and voodoo practices desperately trying to help cure Jessica, while a strange calypso singer follows her around the island, dropping clues in his songs to help her solve the mystery. In an attempt to help the dazed woman, Betsy leads her through the sugarcane fields to a place of Voodoo ritual in one of the film's most frightening sequences.

Far from what most would expect to be a zombie movie, this little chiller manages to sustain creepiness and mystique rather than focus on body-chomping walkers of the dead- No, these zombies are simply unresponsive, mute drones. Another one of Val Lewton's 1940s horror productions, ""I Walked With A Zombie"" is surely one of Lewton's best films (although I'd say ""The Seventh Victim"" and ""Cat People"" rank as his highest). Directed by Jacques Tourneur, who also directed ""Cat People"", the cinematography and direction in the movie is clean and neat, and, despite the fact it's in black and white, it looks like it could have been filmed not long ago at all.

Like with most of Lewton's horror pictures, this film was also ahead of its time- the subject matter of voodoo rituals and magical practices of the sort would have been a risky subject in the early 1940s. I found myself immersed in the storyline halfway through it's short running time, and I was genuinely spooked by a handful of scenes, the introduction to Jessica being the first. The adventure through the maze of sugarcane fields that Betsy leads Jessica on was extremely spooky, and that tribal watchman's disturbing bug-eyes and blank expression was startling, even to myself, someone who has seen hundreds and hundreds of horror movies - that's an image you can't shake from your mind. The entire voodoo practice scene that follows was chilling and extremely well-executed.

The music also adds to the atmosphere, with many jungle drum beats that help enhance that isolated, ""island"" feel that the entire movie sustains so well, with it's swaying tropical brush and backgrounds, as well as the mystical, 'witch doctor'-type themes. Frances Dee is wonderful as our sympathetic heroine, as is Tom Conway as the mysterious sugarcane owner. Christine Gordon's blank portrayal of the 'zombie' wife is also worth noting. Also, I'd like to mention the similarities between this film and 2005's ""The Skeleton Key"", because as I watched this film, I recognized many themes and scenarios from that film (care giving nurse; mute, hexed character; Voodoo rituals and practices; etc, etc). I wouldn't be surprised if ""The Skeleton Key"" drew inspiration from this little-known 1943 thriller.

Overall, ""I Walked With A Zombie"" is an excellent horror picture that was well beyond its years. It contains a handful of disturbing scenes (even to this day), some solid performances, and an engrossing storyline that keeps the viewer guessing. If you saw and enjoyed ""The Skeleton Key"", I'd recommend you go back and watch this modest chiller, and vice versa. Both are very good films, and I cannot help but point out their similarities. All in all a well done, frightening, and atmospheric classic of horror cinema that is extremely enjoyable. 9/10.",9
175,"I Walked with a Zombie shouldn't be too misleading for today's post-modern horror geeks: this won't have the trademark biting and flesh eating, or running for that matter, when it comes to the un-dead. In this case it's more ""old-school"". Jacques Tourner, and his producing partner/collaborator Val Lewton, cooked up this film as their follow-up to Cat People, and while it's no B-movie masterpiece like the former, it provides above all else some effective, oddly evocative imagery to make it near essential for admirers of old horror films. It's a Jane Eyre type story (I would believe, as I've never read the book) as a nurse comes to a small island to look after a woman who's been shocked by a terrible fever- so the family says- and can't speak and is on a motorized sort of functioning physical capacity. But one night the nurse sees a figure move in the tower, and sees it is her- their introduction of course- and it's probably the most effective scary scene of the lot, in the conventional sense.

But from here on in it's more fascinating than really traditionally spooky. The best bits bring out what is unknown in the 'other', which in this case is voodoo witchcraft and superstitions, which involve dances, mojo-dolls (the mojo-doll specifically for the zombie Jessica, played very well by the actress), and lots of scattered objects that spell some of the eeriest signs in any movie. My favorite scene was when Betsy was taking Jessica to where those damned drums were beating on and on, and first we see a dark figure almost in silhouette (this guy, with crazy eyes done by make-up or some other means, is the only real significant human threat as far as zombies go in the film, and is controlled by voice). Then we see a cow's skull, then a dead dog hanging from a tree, and a human skull surrounded by a circle of bones. It's not exactly scary, but this compounded by the exquisite camera-work, gliding alongside Jessica and Betsy as the go along through the field, make things so creepy and even dream-like that it's worth seeing the film alone for that and the voodoo.

The actual plot, with the stuffy man-of-the-house who tries to deny there's anything wrong with his wife, and the mysterious madame of the house, and the drunken brother, aren't quite as interesting even if they are essential to the plot. What they're good for is a baseline for all the other ominous things to pop out, and Tourner and Lewton milk it for all its worth. Only the ending, with the narration switching over from Betsy to some man, is a letdown as far as how its done, not so much in what it means for the characters in the long run. Bottom line, I Walked with a Zombie is very good for its time, and has many scenes and moments that hold up very well by today's horror standards (and, dare I say it, there's a better depiction of voodoo here, as exploitive as it leans towards, than the crude depictions in Italian horror films like Fulci's Zombie).",9
176,"If you go into this movie expecting to be scared, you'll be disappointed. If you expect an intricate plot and superb dialogue like in Tourneur's later Out of the Past, look elsewhere. However, this will be a treat for fans of Tourneur's earlier Cat People.

All the elements that made Cat People such an endearing classic are present. The atmospheric, moody cinematography - some would say among the best ever filmed. The setting on a plantation in the West Indies certainly helps. The low budget and grade-B cast are more than countered by emphasis on lighting effects and mood creation.

The entire story of a nurse coming to the Windies to care for the ""zombie"" wife of a plantation owner flits between wanting to be a horror and a love story. It is neither because it is so beautifully shot that nothing else matters although you do have horror elements like voodoo and witchcraft. There are a number of great scenes starting with the tower/staircase scene introducing the patient, the night-time walk through the cane field, the lunch-time calypso songs done in inimitable West Indian style, the ceremony at the Homefort and the 7 foot+ carrefour with the glassy unblinking eyes and strange walk.

I really liked this movie and admire Jacque Tourneur's visual sense. For me he's a great director. I only wish the film had been a little longer (its only 69 minutes) so audiences could continue soaking up the atmosphere a little longer.",10
177,"""I Walked with a Zombie"" is another little masterpiece from the Val Lewton unit at RKO. What the studio imposed title suggests (a low budget horror film) is anything but. Lewton and his director Jacques Tourneur have crafted a masterful little 69 minute thriller in famous Lewton ""shadows in the dark' format.

Nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) comes to the Caribbean island of St. Sebastian to take care of the wife of plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway). His wife Jessie (Christine Gordon) appears to be in a mindless trance. Betsy also meets Holland's half brother Wesley Rand (James Ellison) who has a liking for the whiskey bottle. Rand fancies himself as a ladies man and pursues the young nurse. While in town with Wesley, Betsy meets his mother, Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett). Meanwhile, Betsy has begun to take pity on Paul and begins to fall in love with him.

With the local doctor (James Bell) unable to help with Jesse's situation, Betsy learns through the Holland's maid Alma (Theresa Harris) of some local customs which include certain ceremonial rites. Betsy takes Jesse to the ceremonial site by way of one of the scariest walks through a corn field that you're ever to see. Once there she again meets Mrs. Rand who seems to know more about the goings on than she is willing to share.

At any rate Betsy begins to suspect that Jesse may be under some sort of spell. As it turns out, there may be others under a similar spell.

Again, this film is not so much a horror film as it is a mystery. Yes, it has horror elements but as is the case with most Lewton films, more is suggested than is actually shown.

The cast is uniformly good. Frances Dee never looked more beautiful. Tom Conway shows that he was a far better actor than he ever received credit for. Even former ""B"" western star Ellison turns in a good performance. Theresa Harris as the maid is both beautiful and mysterious. Darby Jones as a zombie will give you a good scare and Lewton regular Sir Lancelot appears as a calypso singer.

Frances Dee was married to actor Joel McCrea for 57 years until his death in 1990. She lived a long and productive life pacing away at age 96 in 2004. Tom Conway was the older brother of actor George Sanders. James Ellison is probably best remembered for playing Hopalong Cassidy's sidekick in the early films of the series.

An excellent film!",8
178,"Well, the main purpose of my comment is to add my voice to the chorus of people praising this magnificent movie ""I walked with a Zombie"" and the outstanding artist who made it, Jacques Tourneur. Not surprisingly, every IMDb user seems to have deeply enjoyed it.

I dare say that here the cinematography attains the highest levels reached in cinema history. Every single scene is a piece of art. We are in the same category of, say, ""Touch of evil"" or ""Rear window"", and that's all the more amazing considering the meagre budget at Tourneur's disposal. The story is simple but extremely original. And the uneasy, doomed, magical atmosphere created by the author is just unbelievable: what a talent Tourneur had! Well, not a surprise. This man made ""Cat people"" and ""Out of the past""...

Of course, the most precious gem of this treasure-film is the scene with the two women's nocturnal walk in the sugar canes plantation. Beyond any possible praise... And what about the apparitions of the Carrefour? Extraordinary work of cinematic genius.

As we may expect from a film of the 1940s, ""I walked with a Zombie"" is not much scary (or it is? well... probably it is so beautiful that people forget to be scared). Anyway, that's not important. ""I walked with a Zombie"" has to be judged using the parameters of Art, like a Poe's tale.

I recommend this masterpiece with all my heart.",10
179,"Before zombies became synonymous with ravenous, rotting, nearly indestructible animated cadavers with a taste for human flesh, they were magically vivified corpses associated with voodoo folklore. In 'I Walked with a Zombie', nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) is recruited to a Caribbean Island to care for Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon), the wife of plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway), who has been in a catatonic state since being afflicted by a serious fever. Most of the people on the island are descendants of the slaves who were originally brought to the island by the Holland family to harvest sugarcane and, as Connell quickly picks up, resentment lies beneath their superficial politeness and deference. She also learns that there is bad blood between Paul and his half-brother Wesley Rand (James Ellison) that somehow involves Jessica. The more Connell tries to understand her patient's condition, the more she is drawn to the 'hounfour', the centre of the voodoo cult on the island, and to the legend of zombies. The film is very eerie, especially when the nurse and white-gowned Jessica walk through the sugarcane to get to the hounfour, passing creepy voodoo talismans such as skulls and dead animals, and eventually encountering the towering, pop-eyed voodoo-servant Carre-Four (Darby Jones). Wisely, the script never really explains what is happening and the audience can decide on which side of 'natural' or 'supernatural' they fall. For a budget horror movie, the production is very good, as is the cast (although most posters feature the uncanny, staring Carre-Four and the lovely, sepulchral Jessica, neither of them have any lines). The film is recommended for anyone looking for a subtle, spooky confection for a midnight viewing, but NOT for people expecting to see insatiable decomposing hordes, graphic shots of putrescent heads bursting, or oozy cannibalistic buffets.",8
180,"Despite the loud, ghoulish title, 'I Walked with a Zombie' is a very mild mannered film that contains as many elements of drama and dreams as it does actual horror. The horror it does contain is often rather quaint and quiet is effective because of its quaintness and quietness. It dodges almost all of the stereotypes of your typical classical horror film (the female protagonist does let out a blood curdling shriek very early on in the film, but it is a) extremely justified and b) extremely brief, and never does the film return to having such high volume), making it a probably disappointment to some who could be going into this beautiful oddity with expectations totally contrary to those that would let them enjoy such a film as this.

The film is, stylistically, something very special and, in parts, successfully surreal. Many of the more eerie scenes set late at night feel ripped out of one's unconscious subconscious, the visuals are often reflective of a silent film, and the musical score is often either made up of tribal drumbeats or really haunting and gorgeously dreamy music, hardly that which you would typically expect out of such a film. The film, particularly in its last few minutes or so, is also extremely and unexpectedly poetic and has moments mirroring the typical mood of an (unpretentious, may I add and assure) arthouse or even somewhat avant garde film. It is something else entirely...it is something exquisite, sad, soaked in dread, decay, and a dash of the needed humanity. It is something...something of a masterpiece.",9
181,"I often wonder what war-time audiences of the forties thought after leaving ""...Zombie"". Who could have been prepared for what lay behind the penny-dreadful title, surely one of the most poetic renderings of horror in genre history. Books have been written about its creator Val Lewton, and deservedly so. But what's on screen is traceable to the unerring pictorialism of director Jacques Tourneur, and his mastery of the fluid camera. Forget the plot and dialogue, too much of which is half-baked philosophizing, and the performances which, excepting Sir Lancelot's lovely sing-song, are largely secondary. Focus instead on the lyrical scenes that unfold like a shadowy dream as the camera pulls back to reveal the poetic beauty of atmosphere. This is the perfect antidote for viewers max'ed out on the over-FXed, overly literal staple of today. ""Zombie"" shows that Tourneur grasped what Lewton and Hitchcock already knew - that the greatest fright repository is your own imagination.",
182,"Beautiful nurse and narrator Frances Dee (as Betsy Connell) recalls when, ""I Walked with a Zombie."" She is hired by Caribbean plantation owner Tom Conway (as Paul Holland) to take care of his sick wife Christine Gordon (as Jessica). Immaculately made-up and slim in billowing dress, Ms. Gordon appears to be in a zombie-like state. She could be ""possessed"" as noted in the italicized fine print in the opening credits, the victim of a freak fever as mentioned in the script, or one of the walking dead...

While Ms. Dee ponders the possibilities, let us introduce the other important members of the household. Handsome half-brother James Ellison (Wesley ""Wes"" Rand) appears to be in love with the zombie, and perhaps Dee, too. His wise and sober mother Edith Barrett (as Mother Rand) moves in as an ally, but could be involved with voodoo. Happy house slave-like Theresa Harris (as Alma) serves a beautiful breakfast in bed, but could be up to other things when the sun goes down...

Strange as it may sound, the most unbelievable part of this story is when Dee's voice-over interrupts our thoughts to reveal she has fallen in love with ""Paul"" and intends to win his love by making sure zombie wife ""Jessica"" is cured...

Huh?

There hadn't been much evidence to support this assertion; instead, we had a small indication there was an attraction between Dee and Mr. Ellison. No matter, this film is recommended for its stunning visual quality, courtesy of producer Val Lewton, director Jacques Tourneur and photographer Roy Hunt. Picture Greta Garbo playing ""Jane Eyre"" with voodoo and Venetian blinds. Walk with it.

******** I Walked with a Zombie (4/21/43) Jacques Tourneur ~ Frances Dee, James Ellison, Tom Conway, Edith Barrett",8
183,"The zombie flick is a perennially popular subset of the horror genre, and by the 40s various examples had been appearing in the wake of 1932 Bela Lugosi movie White Zombie. While White Zombie was very good, it and the pictures that followed still sat very much in the Dracula mould of horror narrative, with strangers in a foreign land being guests at a mysterious Gothic mansion, whereupon various zombie antics would ensue. However, I Walked with a Zombie, the second production of Val Lewton's RKO B-unit, gives the sub-genre its first reset with an approach that gave the zombie myth its own stature as well as being a subtle and intelligent horror in its own right.

The horrors produced by Val Lewton departed from the genre's norm by doing away with the traditional monsters of 19th century fiction and creating settings and situations that were a little closer to home. I Walked with a Zombie still takes place in familiar zombie ground of the West Indies, but the narrative line is more reminiscent of a romantic drama, with various characters' repressed desire for each other woven skilfully into the plot. And then there is the Lewton trademark of ambiguity. As with Cat People, it is never made explicit whether or not something supernatural has really taken place. If anything this ambiguity is done with even greater skill than in Cat People, with so many build-ups of expectation shattered by logical expectation (such as the woman crying turning out to be a maid), until logic and magic begin to criss-cross and the viewer is left not knowing what to believe.

Like Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie was directed by Jacques Tourneur. As with many horror directors Tourneur uses arrangements of people and props to give an unnerving and claustrophobic feel to the images. But what distinguishes Tourneur is that he does it with such subtlety, rarely venturing outside basic cinematic conventions, aside from the very obvious gloom of the Roy J. Hunt cinematography. Tourneur frequently creates moving backgrounds that are almost hypnotic, transitioning between two scenes with Frances Dee framed against the frothing sea. A few shots later they are discussing the possibility of giving Conway's wife an insulin injection, and Tourneur makes the centre of the screen a window onto leaves billowing in the wind, like the inverse of the sea shot. What's perhaps most clever of all is the game Tourneur plays with the actors' movements. Almost every time a character enters a scene, they do so walking straight towards the camera, often plodding in an almost zombie-like fashion. This is not only very disconcerting in itself (it's an effect you can see in numerous horror movies from Nosferatu to Ring), but it serves to further blur the lines of reality. In this movie, practically everyone looks a bit like a zombie.

In this light, the wooden and occasionally bug-eyed performance of James Ellison is actually rather fitting. With all the sophistication in its story and execution, it's sometimes easy to forget that this is a B-movie, and the low-level lighting was sometimes a necessity to hide cheap set design, while the shoddy acting was sometimes the best they had available (although I must point out that Frances Dee and Tom Conway are pretty good B-flick standards). And perhaps it is this more than anything else that really makes the Val Lewton horrors so outstanding – their uncanny ability to turn their low-end production status around to positive effect.",9
184,"I've never quite made up my mind whether I like this or ""Cat People"" best, but they're both classics of the genre. In the 1940s, when horror was generally on the decline, and suffering from severe unoriginality, Val Lewton of RKO studios came along and more or less single-handedly rescued the genre. He hated the titles of most of the movies, which were invented by the studio, but he would come up with a concept to subvert them and get a good young writer to come up with an interesting story that fit. This one is very much a classic Gothic romance, with elements in common with ""Rebecca,"" set in the West Indies and utilizing the voodoo tradition for atmosphere. More than that, though, it explores issues of colonialism in a surprisingly daring way for the period and genre, with the black servant characters often seeming the most human among the decadent white family. Not to be missed.",10
185,"This eerie movie is a fine example of the subtle horror film exemplified by its director Jacques Tourneur. His films, produced by Val Lewton, were low budget affairs that had to use their limited production values cleverly in order to succeed. Tourneur did this by developing a type of horror film that relied on suggestion and atmosphere. With I Walked With A Zombie, he created a film with a number of haunting sequences that stick in the mind.

The film's story is very loosely derived from the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. Although it's based on entirely different characters and dispenses completely with Jane Eyre herself, instead it develops the story thread of Mr Rochester's experiences in the West Indies with his former wife – the mad woman in the attic. This ambiguous and mysterious element of Brontë's novel is the basis for the idea for this poetic and haunting horror movie. In Tourneur's film a West Indies plantation owner also has a 'mad wife' and the movie revolves around this mysterious woman.

Over and above everything else I Walked With A Zombie is a master-class in rich atmosphere. Light and shadow are presented beautifully throughout; most especially in the famous moonlit walk through the sugar cane field. In this fantastic sequence the heroine follows the zombie woman in a night walk through the fields where she encounters a tall black zombie man. I guess this set-piece epitomises Tourneur's approach to horror film-making – atmospheric, eerie, in the dark. Throughout the film there are many other haunting moments – the sound of distant drums, the sound of the crying woman, the voodoo guitarist. They all invoke an uneasy ambiance.

This certainly is one of the great 40's horror films. It's an excellent example of the subtle, haunting variety of horror films of Jacques Tourneur and it comes recommended to fans of pre-1960's horror cinema.",8
186,"We start off with a fiesty young nurse Betsy (Frances Dee) being offered a job to care for a patient on an island in the West Indies. The patient is Jessica, wife to the plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway). Jessica is a near ghost of a human being, she shows no sign of life on her beautiful face, and is unresponsive to any form of communication. She is prone to creepy episodes of night walking however, that gives our plucky young nurse course to believe there is something more sinister going on here. Rumours are abound about what happened to the poor Jessica, and it looks like her husbands brother is somehow involved in her catatonic state. Will the island's voodoo priests be able to save Jessica, or is it to blame for her state in the first place? If you are expecting some modern style gut ripping zombie action, then get out of here. Go watch Nightmare City 5 times in a row as a penance! This one is all about the atmosphere. It never quite turns into out and out horror like a lot of the Universal films that went before it, but that doesn't mean it ain't got it's own creepy charm. Many scenes stick out, the midnight walk to the old building with the winding staircase, the night time journey to the voodoo church in which the girls encounter the creepiest black man ever before Michael Jackson took that title, and the unusual finale are all favorites.

Indeed, Lewton is probably best known for getting the most out of brooding atmosphere and shadows than full on shockfests, and that's why his films are still loved today. I walked with a Zombie's story is told in a dreamlike fashion, with many of the characters pasts hinted at. We are never given a full explanation for why or how jessica ended up the way she did, the mystery is allowed to live amongst the darkness and through the native songs on the island.

Val Lewton had many hits whilst producing horror for RKO, and this is amongst the fan favorites. Director Tourneur went on to make an even big hit in horror a few years later with Night of the Demon . Thanks to the wonderful boxsets available, new generations can still discover these old gems for themselves, even if their creators have long since stumbled off to that great big graveyard in the sky.",8
187,"Betsy Connell is a Canadian nurse, who's hired to take care for Jessica Holland.She's the wife of Paul Holland, the owner of a sugar plantation on the Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian.The place is populated by descendants of African slaves and a small white community of doctors and officials.Betsy also meets Paul's half-brother Wesley Rand and their mutual mother, Mrs. Rand.Betsy's being told that Jessica's sleepwalking condition is caused by an incurable tropical fever.But there's something else about her.It seems she's living-dead, a zombie.Jacques Tourneur is the director of I Walked with a Zombie (1943).The acting is brilliant.James Ellison plays Wesley Rand.Frances Dee is Betsy Connell.Tom Conway plays the part of Paul Holland.Edith Barrett is Mrs. Rand.The part of Jessica Holland is played by Christine Gordon.Theresa Harris portrays Alma-Maid.Sir Lancelot is a calypso singer, who sings the truth in his lyrics.It's the atmosphere that makes this a really good horror movie.It's really haunting when Betsy goes walking with Jessica to see those voodoo people in the night.This old horror movie is really worth seeing.",9
188,"Well the original meaning of a zombie is not a dead creature that is brought back to life or became a flesh eating monster due to a virus as in today's tales, but is it is a human that has no more will of his own and is directed by witchcraft in this case voodoo. That is what we see with the blonde lady and also the black guard with his big eyes. Well the voodoo scenes are done really well and that is why I pass this movie. However it falls pretty flat in story and characters. None of them is remarkable and the dramatic story with relationship intrigues is just as uninteresting as the standard soap opera. Besides there is too many characters involved which made the whole pretty tedious to watch. The location was nice though.",5
189,This is a clever take on Jayne Eyre by a great producer-director team Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur who made several films for a stick of gum in the early forties and obtained 90 per cent of their effects by allowing the viewers imagination to stand in for cgi which was still decades in the future. Tom Conway may have only had a voice and suavity in common with his brother George Sanders but he makes a half-decent fist of the Rochester role and it's a great chance to catch the elusive Frances Dee as the Jane Eyre figure. She married Joel McCrea in the early thirties and didn't work nearly enough post-nuptials despite being a talented actress and a looker with it. Decent B-picture.,6
190,"""I Walked with a Zombie"" is actually nothing more than an average early horror movie with a simple story. Still the movie is a good one, thanks to the very atmospheric and creepy mood.

The movie is very much like horror movies from the 70's, so in a way it was ahead of its time. The fact that this movie is about a zombie also indicates that it was ahead of its time. Zombie movies became extremely popular again later in the 70's. It's not the first zombie movie (I think that was ""White Zombie"" from 1932 with Bela Lugosi?) but it certainly is one of the most memorable ones.

It's pretty obvious that the movie wasn't shot in the West-Indies and it's some obvious studio work but with World War II still going on that is no wonder of course.

The acting isn't really anything special and so isn't the story like I mentioned before but it is the atmosphere, with its creepy voodoo drums, that makes this movie work.

191,"I Walked with a Zombie was a good movie, not because it was scary, but because, like most pre-70s Horror movies, it was totally explained.

The 1940s concept of a zombie was interesting, especially the way that the movie also explored themes of voodoo.

The nurse was pretty, but unlike many other movies of the time, she was not stupid, in fact, quite the opposite.

A good viewing, but despite all the good points, I walked with a zombie is a little dated by todays standards.",7
192,"Producer Val Lewton made some of the most intelligent horror films of the classic period. Along with ""CAT PEOPLE"" and ""THE LEOPARD MAN,"" ""I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE"" is an atmospheric tale, a masterpiece of psychological horror. Lewton's films always left the viewer to analyse the information presented and to decide for themselves exactly what it was they saw...or thought they saw.

Frances Dee (not to be confused with Sandra Dee), plays Betsy Connell, a Canadian nurse who accepts a job looking after the wife of a sugar cane farmer (Tom Conway) in the West Indies. The farmer's half-brother (James Ellison) also lives son the plantation and is the classic tortured soul, drowning his mysterious sorrows in alcohol. The stricken wife is a beautiful woman who seems to be in a trance. She cannot speak or think...but can follow simple commands. As Betsy settles into life at the plantation and gets to know the family and the native servants, she slowly starts to realize that not all is as it seems. There is some horrible past event that has somehow caused the wife's condition, the half-brothers despair, and the hardening of the farmer's heart. Discovering the source of all that is wrong at the plantation leads her into the mysterious world of Voodoo and zombies.

The screenplay, co-written by Curt Siodmak (the same man who wrote the classics ""THE WOLF MAN,"" ""FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN,"" ""SON OF DRACULA,"" and ""THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS""), is loosely based on the classic novel ""Jane Eyre."" ""I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE"" is a great film, full of eerie atmosphere (the scene where Frances Dee walks up the stone staircase in the tower is a classic of creepiness) and psychological terror, and that guy with the weird eyes is just too freaky! If you can get your hands on a copy of this wonderful classic, you'll be glad you did.",
193,"Great title but I walked with a Zombie is a dull film and even at a running time of 70 minutes it felt too long. It is also not a horror film.

The film is actually a loose adaptation of Jane Eyre as a nurse arrives at a Caribbean island to take care of a sugar plantation owner's mentally disturbed wife who is living in a vegetative state. She has somehow been entranced but can walk at night.

The island has voodoo rituals and the nurse discovers that two half brothers competed for the woman's love. One married her but she planned to run away with the other. The mother a devout Christian herself turned to voodooism to cast a spell on her.

There was so much that could had been done with an interesting premise, calypso beats and a refreshing take on a Creole island culture but the film is so dull. It seems the film itself is inanimate.",3
194,"Before there were horror movies there were horror books, gothic novels. Two of the greatest were written by women, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho. Gothic tales came in two varieties: those in which the horror (Frankenstein) is real, and those in which the supernatural (Udolpho's haunted castle) is only seeming but resolves into a natural cause. Henry James in The Turn of the Screw created a third variation. Is the supernatural imagined or real? We never know. Val Lewton, better than anybody, brought that variation to films, his trilogy of fantasy. Is the were-cat in ""Cat People"" real? Or is it a figment in the disturbed mind of its alter ego Irena? Does Irena's ghost return in ""Curse of the Cat People?"" Or is it a little girl's imaginary friend conjured up out of old photos of a beautiful woman and a name overheard in whispered conversation? Is there a zombie in ""I Walked with a Zombie?"" Or is it a woman whose illness has affected her brain? She has not died, the doctor points out. How can she be a walking dead? She doesn't bleed when stabbed. How can she be alive? It is a question of faith. The grim figurehead, perpetually covered with dripping water as if with blood, represents St. Sebastian. Shot by arrows, he died. But he lived. His nurse, St. Irene, saved him - resurrected him - until he died again. (Screenwriter Curt Siodmak might as well have named Frances Dee's nurse Betsy Irene. Maybe better not. Too obvious.)

The beauty of these films is to leave all unanswered. Wake up from a waking dream and believe what you want. Perhaps the spectral aberrations are meant to be real. I prefer to see them as projections, the products of powerful, disturbed emotions. In ""I Walked with a Zombie"" they are manifestations of guilt and isolation. White people on the tiny Caribbean island are the dominant caste. They own the land. Their ancestors had brought the slaves to work that land, as they still do though no longer slaves. The whites continue to live apart. Their villa is called ""The Fort."" The sinister slave-ship figurehead, Ti-Misery, still presides over it. The memory of inherited guilt and sense of present isolation have twisted Paul Holland. He lives in a tropical paradise. He sees death and decay. ""Everything dies here,"" he tells Betsy. The ocean glows phosphorescent. He thinks of the putrefying residue of a million millions of plankton. Remembrance of past suffering haunts him. A baby is born. Black people lament. ""The misery and pain of slavery,"" he says. ""They weep when a baby is born and make merry at a burial."" Mrs. Rand, a missionary's widow, should repugn the native belief. She joins it. She prays to its god. The African faith surrounds her. It overcomes her. She calls to the sentinel Carrefour. His name means what he is, the Crossroads between two worlds, civilization and exaltation. She crosses over. The zombie is her projection. She herself, she believes, has conjured it.

The acting is superb all around, Frances Dee (her opening voice-over narration is particularly affecting), James Ellison, Tom Conway, Theresa Harris. Edith Barrett, as always, stands out. She adds a flicker of that mental instability, especially in her confession scene, that she did so memorably in ""Ladies in Retirement."" It's sad to recall her own later similar suffering. The most striking performance - no facetiousness intended - in my opinion is that of Christine Gordon as the catatonic Jessica Holland. I know. What performance? you ask. She has only to adopt a look and maintain it for the movie. Yes. But what a look! Watch her face closely, as she waits immobile at the voodoo ceremony, as she stands blocked at the iron gate. It is not the cliched look. There is not a staring, transfixed gaze, as of one whose mind has been hijacked, or mesmerized. It is the look of one who has no mind - totally blank, not possessed or bewitched but empty. That requires genius to achieve, to seem to have erased every thought, even the thought of having erased every thought. I can only imagine the auditions for the part. ""Now turn to the camera, Miss X, and let me see you empty your mind."" How many screen tests must they have done before finding one actress who could do it? Her head slightly cocked to the side, eyes subtly downcast, her features supremely, unutterably vacant, voicelessly, she steals the film, even from Edith Barrett.

The whole film, from the opening shot, figures moving along a moonlit beach, to the dreamlike image of two women walking at midnight through windswept sugar cane fields, is a masterpiece. Wesley enters the sea holding Jessica's dead body. I see The Turn of the Screw, the governess cradling a dead boy. What killed little Miles? Was Jessica already dead when she died? We'll never know.",10
195,"A nurse (Frances Dee) comes to the West Indies to help two brothers (Tom Conway and James Ellison) tend to the older of the two's wife (Christine Gordon), who is stuck in a perpetual trancelike state. Her doctor is mystified, but it's clear that voodoo from the locals must be involved. There are some nice scenes at night in the film, such as a walk through the rustling sugarcane fields, which evoke a dreamy and gothic feeling. The characters involved in the voodoo itself are fantastic, most notably, the solemn Carrefour (guardian of the crossroads), played by Darby Jones, who has an extraordinary appearance. He alone makes the film worth seeing, especially as it's so short at 69 minutes, but it's also great to briefly see the voodoo dancers.

Unfortunately, the film's three main characters are all uninspiring, wandering through this script as if they were the ones who were zombies, at least emotionally. A love is supposed to develop between Dee and Conway, which isn't based on anything we can possibly see, and is therefore unbelievable. The character actions also seem hard to believe at times as well, for example, when they discover the wife doesn't bleed when cut, nothing is done with this information. As in 'Cat People' (1942), also directed by Jacques Tourneur, there are some really nice, eerie moments in this film, but the rest of it is too understated for my taste, and lacking in emotion.",6
196,"For a Quick and Crash Course in Horror Films, here is a Succinct and Workable Formula. For the 1930's, Universal...For the 1940's, Val Lewton...For the 1950's, Hammer. That's it. These were the Films that Defined the Genre Before the 1960's, where Starting with Psycho (1960), the Roger Corman Poe Films, and then Later, After the Code Breakdown, All Hell Broke Loose.

This is One of those Val Lewton Movies. Along with Cat People (1942) and The Seventh Victim (1943), Often Sighted as the Best. A Dreamlike, Hypnotic, Melancholic Movie, it is Quite Different and Distinctive, and as a Side Note, the Black Cast is Given a Straightforward Respect that was Unheard of in the Forties.

There are Many Scenes and Set-Pieces that Make this a Gem. The Relentless Downbeat Tone is Ominous and Oppressive. Things Move and Dialog is Spoken Almost at Half-Speed as the Film is Forever in a Nether World of Sleepwalking Superstition with Characters that All have a Dark Side.

It is a Film Out of its Time. So Decidedly Different and Haunting that when Viewed Today, can be Unsettling Despite the Absence of Gore that has Become Synonymous with the Zombie Genre. This is Not Logical or Rational, in Fact just the Opposite and Therein Lies the Appeal.

It is Interesting to Note an Outrage by the New York Times Critic of the Day...Released in the Middle of WWII it Made the Reviewer Lose All Sense of Proportion and in the Paper's Coverage of the Movie when it was Released Said This

Quoting the The New York Times1943

""But to this spectator, at least, it proved to be a dull, disgusting exaggeration of an unhealthy, abnormal concept of life. If the Hays office feels it has a duty to protect the morals of movie-goers by protesting the use of such expressions as ""hell"" and ""damn"" in purposeful dramas like ""In Which We Serve"" and ""We Are the Marines,"" then how much more important is its duty to safeguard the youth of the land from the sort of stuff and nonsense that their minds will absorb from viewing ""I Walked With a Zombie""? ? ?""",10
197,"Tourneur's horror movies were psychological and did not rely much on special effects.That the producers showed the monster in his terrific ""curse of the demon"" marred that movie badly.Part of the terror which Tourneur creates stems from the atmosphere ,and of the characters (Didn't French Simone Simon have a feline face in ""cat people"" ?) ""I walked with a zombie"" is not a ""monsters"" movie:if you are looking for that ,you must move on;it is the story of a curse ,a subject which Tourneur would often treat (""cat people"" ""curse of the demon"" ""leopard man"" ) as his father Maurice did the very same year as ""Cat people"" (""La Main Du Diable"") The singer and his folk song (Shawn Eliott's 1965 hit was based on it)are downright disturbing and there's a nice use of Chopin's music .",
198,"This is arguably the greatest ""B"" budget movie ever made. Even great fans of this movie, as I am, generally agree it's too short. Although you get a lot of exposition for one of these 70 minute 'second features' there is still too much unsaid. For example, just how evil was Jessica, and in what manner (other than the obvious infidelity angle,) how does voodoo work on this British island which is obviously not Haiti, and how come everyone is wearing tweeds or fall skirt outfits on a sub-tropical Caribbean island ??

If you invest in the 5 disc Lewton 'Horror' set the commentaries will tell you a great deal concerning the way these quickies were made at RKO in the forties. For example, producers and directors almost never got to choose the titles of these movies. ""I Walked With a Zombie"" was a title forced on the production by higher-ups. They had purchased it from Hearst's American Weekly which was kind of the ""Globe"" or ""News of the World"" of its day. It is no wonder this title shows up on most lists of the worst titles ever made. But that's the title not the movie.

(Big Spoiler Alert!) There is much debate about the sequence where Wes carries Jessica's body into the surf. Most, but not all, horror mavens say he is committing deliberate suicide. I have an alternate suggestion. Carrefours the zombie is shuffling after them and Wes is trying to escape with Jessica's corpse. Wes enters the surf to escape and gets caught by the tow! Notice that Carrefours does not (cannot?) go into the ocean. No suicide, no problems with the Breen office.

The ""High Concept"" for this movie was ""Jane Eyre in the West Indies"". That should explain away some shortcomings to the viewer of today, but I doubt that that phrase appeared anywhere in the promotional material at the time. The movie was Art slipped by the brass and it made money. That was all that mattered.",10
199,"Enter one nurse from Canada named Betsy Connell sent to Haiti to help nurse an ailing wife of a rich sugar planter. Nurse arrives and discovers that this wife is living yet has no functions of thought...in other words is alive and dead. The husband is a man said to be indifferent to people's feelings, yet he manages somehow to charm his way unwittingly into the heart of Betsy despite the active attempts of his half-brother Wesley to do exactly that. I Walked With a Zombie is an atmospheric soap opera of sorts surrounded by the folklore, trappings, and ritual of a Haiti that believes and practices in voodoo. The two brothers are unlike yet both seem to have wanted the same thing in the past...and both want the same thing now. Their relationship is held together coursely by their mother, played with grace and skill by Edith Barrett. Betsy, lovely Frances Dee, is stuck in between them and soon a rather weird love triangle of sorts forms. As a story the film is only marginally interesting. But the mood that surrounds the film gives this film its rather elevated status amongst horror aficianados. Produced by legendary RKO legend Val Lewton who brought us The Body Snatcher, I Walked with a Zombie has some great visual moments. The zombie woman walking at night in the wind. The zombie woman and Betsy walking in the night to the ceremony only to be met by the most chilling carrefour(played by Darby Jones in what has to be the most memorable role in the entire film). Animals hang from trees adding to the overall make-up of the film. These images were so deftly directed by the great Jacques Tournier that they make this film a winner through atmosphere alone. The acting is decent yet nothing particularly great. Tom Conway as brother Paul is rather over-doing it in his role, but still his performance has some good points. If you want to see a film where atmosphere is the main character and pushes performance and plot a bit to the side then this one is for you.",
200,"I watched The Seventh Victim recently and was disappointed. Some reviews said that I Walked With a Zombie was much better. I liked the atmosphere in I Walked With a Zombie, but the story was a bit hard to follow, for me anyway, and not a whole lot happened. I think I'm done with this genre, for a while anyway.",4
201,"I walked with a Zombie was, if I recall correctly, my first proper horror movie (not counting monster films such as King Kong, etc). I was aged 10 or 11 and I talked my parents into letting me stay up late and watch it on TV (part of the BBC's wonderful Horror Double Bill season, happy days!). Dad stayed up with me but as he dozed in his armchair I was mesmerised by this Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur classic. I was also scared stiff, the two white ladies walking through the fields of sugarcane late at night, the wind blowing and then the sight of Carrefour, the skinny pop-eyed zombie. Superbly tense and atmospheric. Move on nearly 40 years and the fright aspect seems quite tame. however it still looks and sounds as brilliant as ever. The two women make it to the voodoo ceremony, the excellent lighting and camera work make their white faces strongly stand out amongst the black attendees. This isn't just a horror movie though, it is at least equally if not more so a love story, it looks beautiful in black and white, it wouldn't be the same in colour. It would be another 25 years until director George Romero unleashed flesh eating zombies on the world, I do find it sad that in numerous conversations about the best zombie movies ever made anything pre-1968 very rarely gets a mention. In my opinion, much as I enjoy the flesh eaters, true zombies are those that result from Voodoo and are used as servants/slaves, this and White Zombie being perfect examples.",9
202,"Canadian nurse Betsy Connell arrives on a ship to the West Indies. She has been hired to care for Jessica, the wife of plantation owner Paul Holland. Holland ancestor had brought over many slaves from Africa.

I like the tone and the sense of the white privilege class. I would like more of the black characters early on but they get their chance soon enough. It has a bit of voodoo. It looks relatively good but sometimes, it's a little cheesy. I do like the atmosphere. It has no real action. It's an interesting 40's horror.",6
203,"The cinematography in crisp black and white is excellent; the acting is fine, in particular Frances Dee as Betsy Connell and Theresa Harris as Alma; the lack of music punctuated only by drum beats adds to the tense atmosphere. It's all great... but the story doesn't quite add up. Ambiguity is difficult to carry off in a film (though the producer and director succeeded mightily in 1942's 'Cat People') and at the conclusion of the film I thought, well that was a bittersweet ending but am not sure how we got here. What does it all mean? It's still a gripping movie though.",7
204,"The secret history of Hollywood podcast having ignited an interest in Val Lewton's work within me, I pressed on from a slightly underwhelming experience with ""Cat People"" to watch ""I walked with a Zombie"" - which I did like better.

Betsy (Frances Dee) a young Canadian nurse, heads to a Caribbean island to look after the wife (Christine Gordon) of the owner of a plantation Paul Holland (Tom Conway). The woman has been in a trance like coma, able to walk and eat but not communicate since a mysterious fever struck her. Whilst on the island Betsy begins to fall for Paul, so tries desperately to rehabilitate Jessica, including taking her on the dangerous trip to the local witch doctor, but all is not what it seems.

As I said, I did enjoy ""I Walked with a Zombie"" better than ""Cat People"" - which might be a little sacrilegious in some parts, but I felt that ""I walked With a Zombie"" was a clearer narrative. Aspects of ""Jane Eyre"" and maybe ""Rebecca"" are brought into a story that was inspired by an article about Voodoo from which little more than the title was taken, and forced on Lewton. Even then, I do think that the events of the story could have been clearer and left slightly less to interpretation than they do. There is one aspect of this story that remains unsettling, nearly 80 years later though and that's the bug-eyed voodoo servant played by Darby Jones, who stands motionless in the grasslands until our heroines come near him.

It's a beautifully shot film with some wonderful performances, but just that little bit too mysterious to earn top marks.",7
205,"I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE stars Tom Conway as Paul Holland, a man whose wife Jessica (Christine Gordon) is either suffering from a rare, tropical illness, or has been turned into a zombie. Set in the West Indies, voodoo could very well be to blame. This Val Lewton / Jacques Tourneur collaboration takes another far fetched idea and makes it not only believable, but downright terrifying! It's all about dread-filled atmosphere, accentuated by the distant heartbeat of ceremonial drums. Eerie, unsettling scenes abound. In particular, the late-night stroll through the sugar cane fields, resulting in an unexpected encounter. An unforgettable, highly influential film...",10
206,"Frances Dee portrays ""Betsy Connell"" a nurse hired to travel to a Caribbean island to care for the catatonic wife of a local plantation owner. Once there, she does her best for the poor woman as she slowly falls in love with the husband ""Paul Holland"" (Tom Conway). She decides she must do what she can to help her charge recover and that involves dealing with the local community and using their voodoo. The film is actually quite thought provoking; it touches on the conversation about continuing to live regardless of the quality of life and it questions the role of traditional (and often religiously ethical medical treatments) against what could be described as more pagan ones. It's eerily shot which means at times quite it can be hard to see what's going on, but is still an interesting horror film with virtually no screaming!",6
207,"Although it is too short, and the zombie appearances are few, I find the film fantastic, with a captivating story, good characters and good special effects. One of the best old horror movies. Highly recommend.",8
208,"In line of previous Jacques Tourneur's Cat People this one is a follow up in same direction, bringing the spooky atmosphere at West Indians island where slavery takes place at this period of time, the black people took their mysticism with them as voodoo, the epic night scene through cane field under the moonlight is quite fantastic when they meet the black man Carrefour, stunning story which has a minor fail, is too short, could be more developed to expand the whole thing, even so deserves a look to all moviefan who likes this genre!!

209,"A Hollywood primordial exploration of the now time-honored zombie trope, running around a svelte 69-minute and with the filmmaker who previously brings us CAT PEOPLE (1942), I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE holds its own in its compact narrative that takes place in the Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian, where the wife of a sugar plantation owner has slumped into a zombie-like state, viz. a living dead under the spell of voodoo magic.

Audience are whisked onto the tropical land with our heroine, a Canadian nurse Betsy Connell (Dee), who snatches the well-paid job to minister to the aforementioned wife Jessica Holland (Gordon), whose first apparitional appearance is a mild hair-raiser, and instinctively swoons for her hubby, Paul Holland (Conway), a suave gent ailed by a pessimistic streak, the first thing he tells her is that ""everything is putrescent"". As she dedicatedly takes it on herself to bring Jessica back to the living world, a manifestation of her lofty affection to the man she loves, and is out of step with a more plausible self-serving/possessive maneuver that more likely pops up in the context of romantic pursuit, her last resort to work the miracle hinges on the local voodooism, and the most atmospherically stirring sequence is where she chaperones a sleep-walking Jessica across a nocturnal cane field interspersed with memento mori, to attend an occult ceremony and is appalled by the sight of a dead-fish-eyed guardian Carrefour (Jones), an archetypal zombie embodiment that might give viewers at then nightmares.

Directer Jacques Tourneur, cunningly straddles the explanation between scientific diagnosis and ethnic necromancy, also configures a bare-bones JANE EYRE plot to leaven the narrative, although Frances Dee flourishes as a gamely virtuous can-doer, and theater dab-hand Edith Barrett upstages the rest with a layered rendition as Mrs. Rand, Paul's mother, whose evasive culprit identity actually counterpoints her palpable bonhomie, the film per se is too much an obsolete novelty to be seriously reckoned as a masterwork, not even with the help of Sir Lancelot's calypso invention, especially when he is unceremoniously introduced as a Janus-faced fabulist (apologizing first, scandal-disclosing later).",7
210,"I have always been attracted to the Caribbean region and have found it to be a very mysterious corner of the world. For me, a remote Caribbean island not yet corrupted by large-scale, commercial tourism and floating, high rise hotels serves as the perfect setting for a strange and unsettling film such as this. While one reviewer identifies the island as Haiti, no one speaks French or even has a French accent, so it wouldn't be Haiti. Curiously, the ""filming location"" section on IMDb is blank, and I have yet to discover the actual locale.

As was the case with ""Cat People"", produced only one year earlier, Director Tourneur and Producer Lewton worked diligently to create an ominous atmosphere with much success. Deep within the unseen jungle, the unnerving, ceaseless beat of drums haunts the island's rustling cane fields while the hot, debilitating winds hypnotize the island and all of its inhabitants. We never know when to expect the menacing image of Carrefour, a towering zombie with bulging, catatonic eyes, in search of some lost soul, struggling between this world and another. Whether authentic or not, the voodoo ceremony here is captivating and very creepy.

While the whites on the island, specifically the Hollands and the Rands, hold economic power, they are spiritually dominated by the much more powerful, intangible influence of the local, black culture. While the past misery of the island's black enslavement is very clear, none of the local folks seem to be as unhappy as the white planter family. For example, Alma, the maid (Theresa Harris), may cry when her niece is born, but she is among the few characters who manages to maintain an overall bright and sunny outlook on island life, which has become a debilitating prison for most of the white folks.

From start to finish, this is a very intriguing and entertaining movie. For me, the biggest, unresolved mysteries are the unexplained full story behind the mother, Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett) and the physical attraction of a dish like nurse Betsy to such a gloomy wretch like Paul Holland (Tom Conway), other than the lack of better options available to her. It turns out that Holland needs a young nurse from Ottawa even more than his zombie wife does.",8
211,"Val Lewton and Jacque Tourneur are the forces behind this movie. When we think of zombies, we have a picture in our minds of the characters in ""The Night of the Living Dead"" and numerous movies and TV shows following it, including ""The Walking Dead."" This was made when the zombie was better known as a drink than as a character. This is quite different than what we are used to. A young woman gets a job as a nurse on an island where voodoo is practiced. Her job is to watch after a woman who is pretty much catatonic, who seems to sleepwalk, in a house where there are mysterious circumstances. On the island is a subculture that beats drums and holds meetings doing that voodoo stuff. The woman who is the center of all this has been affected in some way by these people and her husband is also involved in some way. Like many of the Lewton films, it's very low key with incredible atmosphere. I've been wanting to see this film for years and finally had the opportunity.",8
212,"One of the best movies ever made. After viewing it you'll insist that you've just had sex with a zombie and yet you are confused about the implications of it, wary about the ramifications of telling your spouse why your clothing is damp with perspiration.

Or maybe it's the jungle beat, the voodoo stylings, the music of the solemn natives as they dance fever themselves into your psyche, burrowing permanently into a spare crevice of your brain and then forever after waiting waiting and then BAM the pulse of the voodoo demon surfaces into your consciousness and your foot starts tap tap tapping to the brutal thump of the devil drums causing you to instantly strip down to the flesh then quickly don your grass skirt and begin to move furtively, angularly, hips and shoulders loosely grinding to the throbbing ultra low hertz vibration of the walking dead!",10
213,"Frances Dee is a nurse sent to a small island to tend to the lady of the house. But what she wasn't told (at least not right away) is that she is a zombie. Produced by the famous Val Lewton known for his horror movies, this has to be the best of the lot. It is so rich of atmosphere, eeriness, and imposing danger from nearby natives that the viewer feels spooked for no good reason, except that anything can happen anytime to anybody. And, it captures you right from the beginning, and keeps you in knots. This really should be shown in classes in screen writing (and producing) as it includes everything essential to storytelling at its best.

Also starring James Ellison (from ""Charley's Aunt"" with Jack Benny) and Tom Conway (who was George Sanders' brother and who took over the Falcon mystery series from George), this is a must for all true followers of early horror/suspense films. What it may lack in gore or brutal violence, it makes up for in true entertainment, in the fashion of less is more and that can't be bartered with. That is what film lovers demand, and Val Lewton delivers.",9
214,"I enjoyed this more than ""Cat People"", but for some reason I don't rate these two Torneur classics as highly as others do. However, the atmosphere in this film is striking and weirdly beautiful. I will never forget the image of James Ellison walking off into the sea with the zombie-like Christine Gordon in his arms. Very haunting. This film is seen by many as the best film adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel ""Jane Eyre"", which the plot does resemble. It's not, and the Tom Conway/Frances Dee romance is actually quite boring. But the island rituals and general atmosphere of eeriness kept me well-entertained, and the imagery is extremely haunting.",7
215,"This is my 2nd time trying to find merit in this movie. I'm a big noir, Torneur, and b/w fan. But I just can't find the quality that others do. The movie has a premise which w/o development becomes merely a holding pattern. It never amounts to much. The B movie plot is the big problem. It has 'zombie' in the title, so waiting for the word to be spoken by anybody is a timewaster. It does an indescribably poor job at developing a coherent zombie mythos. We know what a zombie is, and that Jessica is one before it's sufficiently explained, then every single time someone contributes further zombie lore, it just gets muddier and muddier.

Only one scene is startling and modern, in which a character reaches an ethnographic understanding of the events. The storyline squanders any interest with indistinguishable comings and goings, and plot developments which are indistinct and moribund. Characters can be relied on to kill time cheaply, spouting deathly talky mumbo-jumbo. It's also claustrophobic (all the main characters turn out to be members of one family) and lethargic.",2
216,"The classic 1943 RKO chiller ""I Walked With a Zombie"" really failed to live up to my expectations. Slow moving and dull, this film does serve up some nice atmosphere and a few creepy moments. However, it ultimately seems like some turgid melodrama with a side trip into the supernatural.

Frances Dee is a Canadian nurse who is hired by Caribbean plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway) to tend his ailing wife Jessica. The poor woman appears to be in a trance and is completely listless. Finding out what ails her and how to make her well forms the crux of the film. Along the way we discover there is considerable bad blood between Holland and his brother Wesley, an affair between Wesley and Jessica, love blooming between Miss Dee & Paul, and suspicion that the wife may have fallen under the influence of a voodoo curse. However, the film spends way too much time on the plantation melodrama and far too little on the supernatural aspects the outrageous title promises.

The cast is pretty solid. James Ellison somehow nabs top billing with his secondary & largely superfluous role of Wesley; his character seems pretty weak and spends his limited screen time either drinking himself stupid or whining. Frances Dee is the lead character and lends class & beauty to the proceedings although her love for Tom Conway is forced and simply unbelievable. Conway is his usual suave self & Edith Barrett gives a winning rendition as his mother. However, the most memorable performance comes from Darby Jones who is remarkably unsettling as a wide-eyed zombie named Carrefour. Jones has no dialogue & one facial expression but he conveys all the menace required from the role and then some.

""I Walked With a Zombie"" is a vastly overrated film in my opinion. It manages to convey an eerie atmosphere at times but gets bogged down in run-of-the-mill melodrama. If one is looking for a superior psychological horror film from the era I would suggest ""The Cat People,"" ""The Body Snatcher,"" and ""Isle of the Dead.""",5
217,"""Betsy Connell"" (Frances Dee) is a nurse living in Canada who accepts a job taking care of the wife of a sugar plantation owner named ""Paul Holland"" (Tom Conway). The fact that it takes her to the tropical island of Saint Sebastion in the Caribbean is an added incentive. On the way there she meets Paul and he acts quite cold and distant to her. Subsequent meetings only reinforce this impression. However, his brother ""Wesley Rand"" (James Ellison) seems much more friendly. But her impression of him changes when she realizes that he has a drinking problem. She also learns that Paul Holland's wife is a sleepwalker. At least, that's what it looks like. Now, rather than reveal any more of the film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that for a movie made during World War 2 this particular zombie film wasn't too bad. Naturally, like most movies of this type made prior to 1968 the catalyst for creating a zombie centers on voodoo rather than a virus or chemical agent. Additionally, the zombies of today are nothing like those back then. In any case, I enjoyed this movie for the most part with my biggest criticism being that it lacked the necessary time (only 69 minutes) to establish any real depth. Accordingly, I rate this movie as slightly above average.",6
218,"You can't fault the cinematography (very good) or the fact that it was shot in Black/White. Especially if you consider the time it was made and the fact that it went against a trend with the Hammer movies. It tried something new and had a subject matter that had not been explored. Another thing you have to keep in mind, the title should not mislead you. It might sound nice and catchy, but is not what you might expect.

It's not exploiting and/or a spoof on the zombies. And it's not ""Zombie"" as in what became known later as zombie. It's voodoo and not undead (or Ghoul as Romero named his flesh-eating creatures himself). So do not expect a movie that has blood and other stuff in it. Expect a very moody piece of movie. It might have some over the top dialogue and some other things going on, but it also touches some subject matters that were very new back then. Oversee the flaws and you will enjoy it very much.",6
219,"A bright-eyed nurse from Canada (Frances Dee, who amusingly resembles Judith Light) takes a position to help an invalid woman down in the West Indies; upon her arrival, she realizes that the lush, tranquil island is not what it seems, that her employer and his brother have a dark family history, and that her ""patient"" is walking the line between the living and the dead. Well-written take on ""Jane Eyre"" has intriguing passages and a perplexing, but attractive heroine. Val Lewton's superlative production and voodoo atmospherics are wonderfully ripe. Cast, cinematography and background score are all top-notch, though the final reel is disappointingly tame and the film ends unsatisfactorily. *** from ****",7
220,"A nurse (Dee) is sent to the West Indies to care for a woman who has been in some sort of a trance for a long time. The sick woman's husband and his brother both fall for the pretty nurse, who is determined to do whatever it takes to cure the woman, even voodoo. Producer Lewton and director Tourneur, working on a limited budget, create a terrific atmosphere at the island plantation where most of the action takes place. The scene where Dee takes the sick woman to a voodoo doctor is quite suspenseful and gorgeously filmed. The only problem is a confusing, abrupt ending which undermines what had been meticulously built-up.",7
221,"Betsy Connell is a young nurse who takes a contract job in the West Indies to join a rich white family. Her job will be to care for Jessica Holland, the wife of plantation owner Paul Holland, who is suffering from an intense coma-like state. Medicine has so far failed to cure her of this but Betsy is to keep her comfortable and looked after. When Betsy is frightened by Jessica walking around in his state, she starts to ask questions that lead her to uncover dark secrets on the small island.

Modern zombie movies consistently freak me out because I am always scared by the things coming at you consistently with only one thing on their 'mind'. This film is well-known but modern zombie fans should accept now that this is not comparable to Night of the Living Dead in regards content but is more of a drama that has a chilling atmosphere and creepy touch to it. The plot sees Betsy uncovering the truth behind Jessica's illness and becoming involved in the cult of voodoo active on the island. It is a simple story and not that engaging but it is a fine example of how the use of lighting, sound and audience anticipation can produce an effective chill without the need for special effects or gore. Long after you have forgotten the rehash of Jean Eyre in the plot, you will remember the use of drums and strange noises to raise the tension of the piece  the drums being as effective as they run as they are when they suddenly stop. The dark images will linger too, with more darkness on the screen than light at times, the use of black characters probably produced more fear in audiences of the time than now but the sight of the Carrefour in the middle of a field is still chillingly delivered.

The cast are OK but they do play second fiddle to the direction and the atmosphere. Dee is typically innocent and frightened; the men are either upright or darkly driven and the black characters, although having a lot more to them than I expected, are still slave stereotypes by any other name.

They are effective and do OK because of the film they are in, but without the atmosphere and tension created by the director etc, their performances would have come off as a lot more clunky than they did here.

Overall this is not a great film but it is a great example of tension and atmosphere delivered by a great director who uses lighting, sounds and a sense of anticipation to make this a lot more chilling that the material would suggest.",
222,"This is not a bad zombie film - it's actually fairly good for what it is. Nurse Betsy is from Canada and she is hired to go to the West Indies to care for Jessica, a woman who's mind seems inflicted with a type of paralysis. Jessica is the wife of Paul Holland - Betsy and Paul fall in-love and Betsy is determined to help Jessica because she believes that is what Paul is wanting.

Jessica is believed to be a zombie and some believe that voodoo is the only cure for her. Is Jessica a zombie or is she simply sick as a result of a high fever?

This would be a great double feature with films like White Zombie (1932), Revolt of the Zombies (1936) or the comedy-horror film King of the Zombies (1941).

223,"When a Canadian nurse (Frances Dee) arrives in the Caribbean to take care of the ailing mute wife of plantation owner Tom Conway, she finds more than she bargained for thanks to the surrounding natives, Conway's mysterious brother (James Ellison) and secret-carrying mother (Edith Barrett). The ailing wife allegedly was guilty of adultery and the sinful actions lead to her physical state in a way that is revealed in a surprising and spooky manner.

The customs of the natives are explored in detail and while on the surface they seem over the top, in retrospect, they are presented very subtly with only subliminal hints of Satanistic evil. Dee plays her character with the same passionate curiosity that made Judy Davis's performance in ""A Passage to India"" and Meryl Streep's in ""Out of Africa"" so filled with a desire to understand something more than what one grew up around.

The viewer gets more glimpses into the secrets of the Rand family thanks to the Calypso singer (Sir Lancelot) who follows Dee around and fills her in through song as to the family legend as if he was Harry Belafonte singing ""Day-O!"". The dancing during the voodoo ceremony is presented as very sensual which adds to the already poetic feeling of the story's theme. In spite of some implausibilities, the cast plays their parts with subtle seriousness, yet never giving a tongue-in-cheek that makes it camp. As directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced by Val Lewton, this is one of the most visually satisfying horror films with eerie music and outstanding photography to add to the intriguing story.",7
224,"Val Lewton produced this horror film(directed by Jacques Tourneur) that stars Frances Dee as Betsy, a Canadian nurse who goes to the West Indies at a sugar plantation to care for the invalid wife of the plantation manager Paul Holland(played by Tom Conway) She has fallen into a catatonic state, but mysteriously walks at night, and is followed by Betsy. Rumor has it that the wife,(Jessica) was in love with Paul's half-brother Wesley(played by James Ellison). Their mother Mrs. Rand(played by Edith Barrett) is also the local doctor, not above using the local voodoo religion to give them their medicine. Is voodoo at the heart of this mystery? Eerie and unique film belies its silly title to give a most understated exercise in terror. Needs multiple viewings to fully appreciate.",7
225,"A great use of 69 minutes, the total running time for this taut Val Lewton produced thriller, loosely based on the ""Jane Ayre"" mad-wife story but given a voodoo twist by setting the action in the Caribbean and making the wife a zombie throughout the whole of the movie, in fact she never speaks a word throughout the whole movie. Famed for his low-budget horror films in the early 40's, any budgetary limitations are well concealed with some effective interior sets combined with atmospheric location shooting. In fact the most noticeable sign of a scarcity of funding cash is probably in the lack of big- name star-power in the cast, but this is more than compensated for by a committed ensemble performance from the actors. I might have wished for some less obvious stereotyping of the black natives blindly following their pagan culture and particularly the pop-eyed caricature of a possessed ""devil"" sent to reclaim the comatose wife, but that aside, the story is well told and acted throughout. The best touches though are the suspenseful scenes, like when nurse Betty first follows walks her zombie patient at the dead of night and their later midnight run to the native compound where some very mildly suggestive possession of two native girls takes place and later the practice of the voodoo that will lead to the expected tragic denouement. In any 70 minute feature, short-cuts are bound to be made in characterisation and plot exposition, but I think I got enough of what I needed to appreciate the story.",7
226,"Just like John Tucker Must Die, the film itself doesn't really live up to the really good title, but this film did appear in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, from director Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, Build My Gallows High). Basically young Canadian nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) has come to the West Indies, Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian, to care for the wife of sugar plantation manager Paul Holland (Tom Conway). His wife Jessica (Christine Gordon) has been suffering a form of mental paralysis, like being catatonic, after contracting some kind of fever. Over the time she spends with Jessica and more predominantly with Paul in Fort Holland, Betsy meets his half-brother Wesley Rand (James Ellison) and their mother Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett). Betsy is also finding herself falling for Paul's charms, despite trying to help his wife which she is determined to do, mainly for him. Near the home, there is a constant voodoo ceremony going on, and Betsy does think of using this to help Jessica come out of her state of paralysis. After an encounter with a very creepy black slave Carrefour (Darby Jones) walking like a zombie and in a similar state to Jessica's, Mrs. Rand confesses why she is in the state she has been for some time. She apparently went to a voodoo ceremony and cast a spell over Jessica when she threatened to run away and destroy her marriage to Paul, but it doesn't matter now, because Paul confesses to the love for Jessica dead and gone, and a new love for Betsy. Also starring James Bell as Dr. Maxwell, Theresa Harris as maid Alma and Sir Lancelot as Calypso Singer. I think it is more the atmospheric lighting, loads of shadows and the creepy music by Roy Webb that is meant to create the tension in this meaningless but at the same time worthwhile classic horror. Very good!",7
227,"Frances Dee (Mrs. Joel McRea), a Canadian nurse, takes a job on the small Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian. Her duty is to care for the wife (Christine Gordon) of the owner of the sugar plantation (Tom Conway). Conway's brother (James Ellison) manages the place. Assorted characters are present, including Theresa Harris as the maid, Sir Lancelot as the calypso singer (what else?), and Darby Jones as the tallest, most bug-eyed shuffling zombie you ever saw.

Conway's wife is in what appears to be a semi-coma. She mostly lies in bed, dressed in a flowing, translucent dressing gown, fully made up, looking glamorous. Sometimes she rises up and walks about with a vacant stare. Dr. Maxwell -- great name, there -- tells us that the condition is wholly medical, but others have different, more fanciful explanations. The maid believes Conway's wife is possessed by voodoo spirits and can only be cured by them. James Ellison blames himself. So does the mother of Ellison and Conway (Edith Barrett, Mrs. Vincent Price). Conway blames himself and his family, who brought slavery to the island. The only guy who doesn't seem to blame himself or anybody else is Darby Jones, the speechless, pop-eyed zombie. The story ends tragically -- or, let's say, sadly -- but things are resolved and Tom Conway, who has fallen for Nurse Frances Dee, who has fallen for Tom Conway, is now free to marry her. Or him. That sentence was confusing.

A couple of notes about what is really quite a fine picture made on Lewton's typical low budget. One is that James Ellison is the only person in the cast who can't act. He sounds like Robert Stack and moves like the Golem. Tom Conway is much better -- not just because of his suave British accent but because he shows some sensitivity to the role. The people of color are treated not with condescension but with ordinary dignity. Theresa Harris as the maid is particularly good. She smiles cheerfully and helps with moral problems as well as housekeeping. We ought to keep in mind that this movie was made during the same time period that African-Americans like Mantan Moreland and Willie Best were running around at other studies, their eyeballs bulging, exclaiming things like, ""Feets, don't fail me NOW!"" But then Lewton and his director, Jacques Tourneur, treat everyone fairly in this film. There is no heavy. And the voodoo presentation is subdued. The up-tempo dance at the ceremony isn't too far from being accurate, some evidence of dance training aside. I won't get into it but voodoo ceremonies of today involve a lot of rum spitting and tobacco-smoke blowing and one or two cutting the heads off chickens to get blood. The dances are less restrained and sexier.

Frances Dee is just fine in her role. She's so good looking -- petite and delicate and flouncy. The story, as has been noted, seems lifted from ""Jane Eyre,"" but there are also elements of ""Rebecca"" and even Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw."" Nurse Dee, a beautiful young woman arrives on an island with evidently only two white guys, the brothers. One of them owns the place, is polite, protective, and distant, and somewhat mysteriously sad. The other brother just works on the plantation and is a resentful drunk. One wonders how long it took the nurse to figure out which one to aim for. The story is not the most finely tuned. At times it seems disjointed. I couldn't follow all of the events and don't know why some of them took place, except, in a few instances, to introduce a scare for the horror-movie audience. Each scene is packed with information but the place is a little slow. There are none of Lewton's famous ""buses"", the nick name Lewton's unit at RKO gave to sudden moments of sheer fright. This is more spooky than shocking.

I'm constantly amazed at how Lewton, an immigrant Russian with little background in films, could turn out so many carefully crafted movies with so little money, such filigreed minor masterpieces of mood, atmosphere, and character. The sets were mostly left-overs from earlier RKO productions, but so finely dressed that they seem to belong to his films alone. The photography and lighting are exemplary. The direction is original and tasteful. If ""I Walked With a Zombie"" were remade today (and it might be), it would be full of ghastly close shots of horrifying zombie faces, munching human flesh, blood dripping down their jaws.

This is one of many instances in which well enough should be left alone.",7
228,"Apparently, Lewton felt that this was his best film for RKO. He may well be right.

It is smooth, well-paced and has some great imagery. It was the second movie from the Lewton unit and although it is by no means a full-on horror movie it is still much closer to the expectations of traditional horror fans than subsequent Lewton productions. Like other Lewton films, the story is a bit undercooked. It is never clear exactly who is responsible for Jessica's comatose state or whether she is actually a zombie or not. Neither is it clear why the voodoo priest wants her back and wants her dead.

Nonetheless, it delivers a number of classic Lewton sequences and makes for an impressive and memorable seventy minutes viewing.

I generally agree with what most of the other commentators on this site have said, but I do take issue with one of them on one point. My only disappointment when I viewed it on DVD, as part of the Lewton Horror Collection, was the poor quality of the print used for the transcription. It is pretty good, but not immaculate. This is not an obscure movie rescued from near oblivion. It was well regarded in its time, has been well known ever since and frequently turns up at festivals and on TV. I know that pristine prints still exist because I have frequently seen them, so why did Warner Video not track one down? Other movies in the collection are almost flawless, so why not the one that is arguably the best of them all?

It is good to have this fine movie in my collection, but disappointing that once again a classic movie has been dumped onto DVD in a print not worthy of it.

The verdict?

Warner Video: 'could do better'.

PS: Since writing this, it has been pointed out to me that it is often easier to find good prints of obscure movies than of famous ones, because they have been through a projector less often. I should also remember that I first started watching this movie thirty or forty years ago, when all the available prints were much fresher than they are now.

PPS: Since the mid-Fifties, TV companies have had packages of old movies that are only rarely broadcast. I suspect that they are holding many of the best prints.",8
229,"This film was made on a very low budget and was called a ""B"" film, which was usually shown along with another ""B"" film, a Newsreel and a few Cartoons as a Saturday night feature during the 1940's through out movie houses. Tom Conway,(Paul Holland),""Voodoo Woman"",'57, was a big success at the time in Hollywood, playing in the Falcon Series and helped to draw the crowds to see this Voodoo black and white horror film. All that Darby Jones was required to have in this film, was Height and Eyeballs that almost came out of his head and never BLINK. Tall Darby Jones played (Carre Four), the zombie who towered over Frances Dee. She was the nurse who finds happiness with Tom Conway, a sugar planter whose wandering wife has been zombified by his mother. Frances Dee, (Betsy Connell), Jessica Holland's nurse gave a great supporting role. This is a classic film from the 40's and if you liked Tom Conway at the height of his career, this film will entertain you.",8
230,"Betsy O'Connell is hired as a nurse by Paul Holland (a sugar plantation owner), to look after his wife, Jessica, at his West Indies manor. Betsy meets Wesley Rand, Holland's half-brother, who tries to cheer her up from all of the eeriness and depressing atmosphere of the manor, which has been described by Paul. According to Dr. Maxwell (Jessica's physician), Jessica suffered from a tropical fever which in turn damaged her nerves turning her into a literal zombie, but many natives (superstitious) in the village claim her sickness is a result of a love triangle with Paul, Wesley, and Jessica. The maid, Alma, believes that the witch doctor of the island, Mama Rose, can cure her, but Paul and Wesley's mother, Mrs. Rand says that Jessica is incurable, but when Betsy takes Jessica to the with doctor, she finds out Mrs. Rand is the healer because the natives rather believe a person who speaks from the gods rather than a white woman. While Betsy discovers this, the native begin a ceremony with Jessica but are perplexed by her zombie-like state. After Betsy takes Jessica back to the manor, the natives perform voodoo to lure Jessica back to the ceremony, while at the same time, authorities try to get Jessica into a hospital on the mainland which further the rift between Paul and Wesley. Very good film, even though the title suggests a cheesy 60's sci-fi film. Tourner does a brilliant job if directing showing this psychological mystery film with the right touches of eeriness and poetic storytelling. The film boasts great characters who all have their stories and secrets. Dee turns in a nice job of the storyteller where we see the plot developments and secrets as she sees them. The romance that Dee feels for Conway is touched on differently, since her character would rather have Conway's character experience the happiness of having his wife healed than the standard forbidden love. Ellison probably gives his best performance as Wesley. Many of the characters' stories aren't developed fully enough, but its forgivable in a 69 minute film. Interesting ending. Rating, 8.",8
231,"Writer/producer Val Lewton belongs right up there alongside the likes of Alfred Hitchcock: his contribution to cinema noir is THAT important. (Pick up any one of the numerous volumes purporting to be ""about"" films noir and check the table of contents and the index: if you don't find the name Val Lewton, put the book down: it's not only incomplete, it's inaccurate; disregarding Lewton is tantamount to overlooking Hitchcock.) I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (based loosely on Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE) is second only to THE BODY SNATCHER (based on the story by Robert Louis Stevenson). Director Jacques Tourner crafts a satisfying, suspenseful tale of life after death. It was Tourner whose deft direction elevated the first of the Lewton films, CAT PEOPLE, head and shoulders above the rest of the fright films of the day. The sole episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE that he directed- based on a Richard Matheson short story- has the unmistakable feel of a feature film and, although he was rarely given the opportunity to direct in his later years, he still had the one thing that Alfred Hitchcock had once boasted could never be taken from HIM: talent. It's been suggested that I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE will be remade. If so, put it on the shelf alongside the other remakes, where it belongs, and go back and watch the original.",10
232,"While not as famous as some of Lewton and Tourneur's combined efforts, this is a wonderful horror film. The peripheral players often steal the show, and the Calypso tattletale ballad scene is a dandy. But the Voodoo sequences are what make this film special. The rhythmic roll of the native drums has hypnotic quality, and when the soiree swings into chanting, Catholicism clasps hands with Pagan gods. The call-and-response litany is straight from the golden days of the Roman rite. Even the screen at the door of the hut where Mrs. Rand pops her first surprise is reminiscent of the RCC's confessional. But the Big Question remains: WHOSE is the voice that intones: ""Leave them alone -- let them go?"" Is this not the same voice overdubbed in the final scene? At least as good as James Earl Jones, and this comes after the drowned lovers are found by torchlight-bearing searchers who are crooning a hymn-like melody. True fatalism combined with inevitable girl gets tormented guy ending makes it all worthwhile. TJM",
233,"The team of Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur were responsible for some of the finest, most unusual suspense films, and this ranks among them. Though some of the romantic aspects of the plot are cumbersome, the film is worth watching on the strengths of cinematography and general mood alone. In particular, the scenes of Betsy's nighttime sojourn with Jessica into the fields in order to find the voodoo ceremony has to rank as one of the most nervewracking on film. The appearance of Carrefour is more frightening since it is shrouded not in screams, but in the quiet of rustling cane. The performance of Sir Anthony is a definite highpoint as well. This film is somewhat difficult to come by but has been screened several times within the last year on the classic movie channels. Quite an excellent little film for those who like their ""horror"" films marked by lyricism and mystery rather than graphic detail.",
234,"SPOILERS

With the second World War approaching it's end, there were a mixture of films which were either war or death based. On one side of the scale we were presented with films which represented the other side of warfare, classics like ""Casablanca"" (1942) and films which were more based on what made a person ""alive"". In 1943, ""I Walked With A Zombie"" was released. With a decent cast, the story was at times intense and based itself on the real fear of the undead. Sadly 60 years later, the story feels incredibly unfulfilled in contrast with modern horror.

Nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) travels to a remote Caribbean island where she begins to treat the ill Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon). As Connell begins to fall for Holland's husband Paul (Tom Conway) however, her desire to cure Jessica using voodoo medicine also increases.

The biggest problem with this film is just how much cinema has advanced from this time. When Betsy first meets Jessica, the film is at it's scariest because we imagine that the screen will be much worse than it eventually is. Jessica is basically just a beautiful actress without expression. In the modern world we have tons of these, some of which actually win awards. This causes the film to falter really since the true fear it should inspire is constructed in the modern mind as a result of images from more recent films.

All in all, for the 1940s this film is a horror classic. At the time, at a time when Bogart and others were dominating the screen, there is little doubt that this film would scary the living daylights out of people like modern films like ""The Ring"" (2002) do nowadays. So many years after release however, it has lost it's sting and any sort of fear is as a result of expecting some sort of jump, similar to more recent films. This film is worth watching as a history lesson on how films used to be made, but for any sort of terror, perhaps horror has been proved to be a genre which is scarier at time of release.",6
235,"I know this film is getting high marks because of the cult producer, but man, it's not good. Slow beyond belief and rather dull. Stylistically it LOOKS real good, and therein is the 2 star rating.",2
236,"I was looking forward to watching this as Jacques Tourneur's 'Night of the Demon' is one of my favourite films so I was hoping something of similar quality.

It started off OK and I was fairly interested in the characters. It's quite atmospheric, though not as atmospheric as Night of the Demon.

After a while though, I got bored with the story and characters. It was very slow paced and not a lot happened.

I give it a 4 for the music and atmosphere.",4
237,"This is one of the few movies that really hand suspense throughout it from the beginning to the end (though it only runs 69 mins). Such a misterious and weird atmosphere reminded me William Wyler´s ""The Letter"". The script is not as good as The Letter´s, but it certainly has moments that can chill your spine. Those moments are such as when Betsy meets Jessicca in the creepy tower and when the same couple walks through the ""voodoo forest"", finding horrifying objects such as animal skulls. And one remarkable moment is when Betsy is sitting with Wesley and the native starts singing the story of the Holland and Rand family, and the love between Wesley and Jessicca, etc... In fact, the movie is those three moments and some more celluloid between each of those scenes. Anyway, this is a wonderful movie with great acting and a horrible cinematography, but what can you expect from 1943?

238,". . . is one of the many medical dramas from that era showing that what was then referred to as ""The World's Second Oldest Profession""--Nursing--was one of the quickest ways for a lady to earn her MRS. degree back then. I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is somewhat of an outlier, as most of the movies churned out from this mold involved wounded World War Two servicemen getting serviced by and sometimes wedding the female nursing staff (this being the benighted times BEFORE ""Don't ask, don't tell""). Instead of being called upon to serve a private with major wounds (or vice versa), Nurse Betsy's I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE adventure calls her up to action on behalf of a wealthy husband with a nonfunctional wife. As brother Wes notes, Betsy has all the meds necessary to allow her to fill this breach herself through attrition. Sadly, Betsy is not the sort of chick to get her hands soiled, forcing Wes himself to step in and do the dirty work. But as so many G.I.s found out to their delight in the mainstream cinema nursing docs, ""Things go better with Cloak""--whether it's the white shroud of secrecy surrounding the nursing ""profession,"" or their white wedding-like capes that do nothing to bridle their inexorable march toward that hallowed Bridal Aisle.",7
239,"I Walked with a Zombie (1943)

** 1/2 (out of 4)

Critics usually eat this Val Lewton film up but it's never really worked for me. The whole idea of a nurse taking her patient to voodoo people to cure her is rather interesting but the story is bogged down with the side story of the nurse loving the woman's husband and other issues with the brother. Director Jacques Toureur makes a good looking picture but I never really thought the film had too much atmosphere going for it and the leads are rather dull. I certainly understand why some people love this film but it just doesn't work for me.",
